This code is a Haskell implementation of the popular 2048 game. It includes functions for the game logic, the main loop for playing the game, and rendering the game board using ANSI escape codes for colors and formatting. The game logic includes functions for moving the tiles in four directions, checking for a win or loss, and adding a new tile (either 2 or 4) to the board. The main loop allows the player to make moves using the arrow keys and displays the updated board after each move. The rendering function uses ANSI escape codes to display the board with different tile colors based on the value of the tiles. The code provides a complete implementation of the 2048 game in Haskell.
