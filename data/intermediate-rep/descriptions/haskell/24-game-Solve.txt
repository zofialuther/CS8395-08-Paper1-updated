This code defines a set of functions to generate and solve arithmetic expressions that evaluate to a given result. The `Expr` data type represents a constant integer or an operation with two sub-expressions. The `toDoc` function converts an `Expr` into a human-readable, parenthesized string representation. The `ops` list defines different arithmetic operations and their corresponding functions. The `solve` function takes a target result and a list of numbers, then generates all possible arithmetic expressions using those numbers and filters out the ones that don't match the target result. The `split` and `select` functions are used to split a list of numbers into two parts for generating expressions. Finally, the `main` function uses `solve` to find all expressions that evaluate to 24 when given the numbers 2, 3, 8, and 9, then prints them to the console.
