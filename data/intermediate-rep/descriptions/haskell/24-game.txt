This code is a program that implements the 24 Game. It generates four random digits in the range 1 to 9 and prompts the user to use the +, -, *, and / operators in reverse polish notation to create an expression that equals 24. The program then validates the user's expression and provides feedback on whether it is correct or if the digits used are incorrect. The code also includes a Reverse Polish Notation calculator with error handling to evaluate the user's expression.
