This code defines a puzzle called "4 Rings or 4 Squares" and provides functions for generating the possible combinations of numbers to solve the puzzle. The rings function takes in a boolean value and a list of integers, and then uses a series of functions including queen, leftBishop, rightBishop, and knights to generate the possible combinations of numbers to solve the puzzle. The main function tests the rings function with different input values and prints the results.
