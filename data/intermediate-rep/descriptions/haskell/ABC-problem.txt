The given code is a Haskell program that solves the ABC problem. The spellWith function takes a list of blocks and a string as input, and returns a list of all possible ways to spell the input string using the given blocks. The main function tests the spellWith function with various input strings by checking if the resulting list is not empty after converting the input string to uppercase. The blocks used in the test are defined as a list of strings.
