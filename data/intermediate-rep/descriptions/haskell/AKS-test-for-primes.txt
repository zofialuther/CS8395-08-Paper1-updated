The code creates a program that calculates and prints the expansion of the polynomial (x-1)^p for small values of p and then checks for primes up to 100. The 'expand' function uses the scanl function to calculate the coefficients of the polynomial expansion. The 'test' function checks if a number is prime using the polynomial expansion. The 'printPoly' function formats the polynomial for display. The 'main' function prints the expanded polynomials for p from 0 to 10 and then prints the primes up to 100.
