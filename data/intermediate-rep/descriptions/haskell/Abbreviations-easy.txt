This code defines functions for checking if a given string is an abbreviation of a command and for expanding abbreviations into full commands based on a provided command table. The isAbbreviationOf function checks if the abbreviation is a valid abbreviation of the command, and the expandAbbreviation function finds the full command based on the provided abbreviation and command table. The main function takes user input, processes it to find abbreviations, expands them into full commands, and then prints the resulting commands.
