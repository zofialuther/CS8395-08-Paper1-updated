This code takes a given text file with lines of words separated by dollar characters. It then aligns each column of words by ensuring that words in each column are separated by at least one space. Additionally, it allows for each word in a column to be either left-justified, right-justified, or center-justified within its column. The code breaks down the input text into rows and calculates the maximum length of each column. It then formats the text according to the justification specified, adding spaces as needed to align the columns.
