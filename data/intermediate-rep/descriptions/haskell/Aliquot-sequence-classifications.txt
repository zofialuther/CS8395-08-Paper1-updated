This code defines a set of functions to classify and calculate the aliquot sequence of a given number. The 'divisors' function returns a list of divisors of a given number, while the 'aliquot' function calculates the aliquot sequence. The 'classify' function categorizes the aliquot sequence into different classes such as Terminating, Perfect, Amicable, Sociable, Aspiring, Cyclic, and Nonterminating. The 'main' function demonstrates the use of these functions by classifying and printing the aliquot sequences of a set of numbers.
