This code defines functions to check if a given number is prime, find prime numbers, and find k-prime numbers. The isPrime function checks if a number is prime by testing for divisibility with all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. The primes function generates a list of prime numbers. The isKPrime function checks if a number is a k-prime, meaning it can be expressed as a product of k prime numbers. The kPrimes function generates a list of k-prime numbers. The main function prints the first 10 k-prime numbers for k ranging from 1 to 5.
