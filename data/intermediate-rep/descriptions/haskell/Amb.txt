This code defines a function called `joins` that takes two strings and checks if the last character of the first string matches the first character of the second string. The code then demonstrates two different desugaring methods for the list monad using the `bind` operator and `concatMap`. It also includes a `main` function that prints the results of applying the desugaring methods to a set of example strings.
