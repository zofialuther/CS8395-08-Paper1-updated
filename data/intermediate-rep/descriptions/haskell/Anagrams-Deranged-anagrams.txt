This code reads a file containing a list of words, groups the words based on their sorted characters, finds pairs of words that are anagrams, and then identifies the pair of words that form the longest deranged anagram. If no deranged anagrams are found, it outputs a message indicating so. If deranged anagrams are found, it outputs the pair of words forming the longest deranged anagram.
