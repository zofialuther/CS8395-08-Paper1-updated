This code uses the HGL (Haskell Graphics Library) to create an animation of a pendulum swinging. It sets up a window and then uses a mathematical model to calculate the position of the pendulum at each time step. The graphics are drawn to the window using the HGL library functions, creating a visual representation of the pendulum's movement. The animation is run at a frame rate of 30 frames per second.
