The provided code is a Haskell program that generates a sequence of Highly Composite Numbers (HCN). The program includes functions to calculate the first prime factor of a number, find all prime factors of a number, count the total number of factors for a given number, and calculate the divisor count for a given number. It also includes a function to generate the next HCN in the sequence and a function to generate the entire HCN sequence. Finally, the main function is used to print the first 20 numbers in the HCN sequence.
