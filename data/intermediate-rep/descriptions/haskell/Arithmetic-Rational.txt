This code will print the first N perfect numbers, where N is set to 4. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through a range of candidate numbers and filters them based on a condition. The condition checks if the sum of the reciprocals of the factors of the candidate number is equal to 1. The getSum function calculates this sum using the Ratio data type. The code then prints the first N candidate numbers that satisfy the condition.
