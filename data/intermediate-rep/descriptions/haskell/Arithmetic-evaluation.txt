This code is a Haskell program that defines a data type for representing arithmetic expressions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a parser for these expressions and an evaluator function to compute the result of an expression. The main function demonstrates the usage of the parser and evaluator by parsing and evaluating the expression "(1+3)*7", and then printing the result. The code makes use of the Parsec library for parsing.
