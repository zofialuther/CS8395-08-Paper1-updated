The code defines a function to calculate an approximation of the arithmetic-geometric mean of two numbers. It uses an iterative approach to improve the approximation until it meets a specified level of accuracy. Additionally, the code includes a function to calculate the relative difference between two numbers. The main function uses these functions to calculate the arithmetic-geometric mean of 1 and 1 divided by the square root of 2, and then prints the result.
