This code defines a function called "mean" that takes a list of numbers and calculates the mean (average) of the values in the list. It first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 in that case. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the values in the list and divides it by the total number of values in the list using the "genericLength" function from the Data.List module. The result is the mean of the input list.
