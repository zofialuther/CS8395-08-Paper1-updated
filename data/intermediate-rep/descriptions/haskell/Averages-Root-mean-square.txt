This code defines a function called rootMeanSquare that takes a list of Double values and calculates the root mean square of the values. It uses the genericLength function from Data.List to get the length of the list, then uses foldr to sum the squares of the values. The result is then divided by the length of the list and the square root is taken. In the main function, it prints the root mean square of the numbers 1 to 10.
