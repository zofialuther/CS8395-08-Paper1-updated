This code defines a data type `BalancedTernary` that represents numbers in a balanced ternary system. It includes functions for zero trimming, normalization, conversion to and from integers, addition, and multiplication. The instance implementations for `Eq`, `Show`, and `Num` allow for comparisons, display, and arithmetic operations on `BalancedTernary` numbers. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the defined functions by performing arithmetic operations on balanced ternary numbers and displaying the results.
