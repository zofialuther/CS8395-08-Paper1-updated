This code is a Haskell program that generates a Barnsley fern fractal using affine transformations. It defines four affine transformations and a function that applies a random transformation to a given point. The 'fern' function uses a sequence of random numbers to generate points in the fern, and the 'drawFern' function creates a diagram of the fern composed of a specified number of points. The 'main' function uses a random number generator to generate a PNG image of the fern with a specified width, height, and number of points. The program can be called from the command line to generate the image.
