The given code defines a function `bellTri` that generates the Bell Triangle, a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The `bell` function then extracts the first number from each row of the Bell Triangle to produce the sequence of Bell numbers. The `main` function prints the first 10 rows of the Bell Triangle, the first 15 Bell numbers, and the 50th Bell number.
