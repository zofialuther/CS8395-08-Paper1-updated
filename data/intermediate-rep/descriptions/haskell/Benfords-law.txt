This code defines a function `fstdigit` that takes an integer and returns its first digit as an integer. It then generates a list of Fibonacci numbers and extracts the first digit of each number. The frequency of each digit is then calculated and stored in a map using the Data.Map library. Finally, a table is created with the frequency of each digit and its corresponding logarithmic value, and the table is printed.
