This code contains a binary search algorithm that can be used to search for a specific element in an array. The `bSearch` function takes a comparison function and a range, and returns the index of the element if it is found, or `Nothing` if it is not. The `bSearchArray` function applies the binary search to an array of elements and returns the index of the specified element, if found.

The code also includes a test scenario where an array of strings is created and the `bSearchArray` function is used to search for a specific string. If the string is found, the index is printed, otherwise, a message indicating that the string was not found is printed.
