This code is a module for drawing a line on a bitmap image. It uses the ST monad to perform mutable state operations. The `line` function takes an image, two pixels representing the start and end points of the line, and a color. It then calculates the coordinates of the line and sets the pixels along the line with the given color. The algorithm used takes into account the steepness of the line and adjusts the calculations accordingly.
