This code is a Haskell module that provides functions for reading and writing Netpbm image files. The `readNetpbm` function reads a Netpbm file from the specified path and returns an `Image` in the `RealWorld` monad with the specified color type. The `writeNetpbm` function writes the given `Image` to a file at the specified path. The code uses the `ScopedTypeVariables` language extension and imports modules for working with bitmaps, character data, file I/O, and monad operations. The `readNetpbm` function parses the Netpbm file format, extracts the image dimensions and pixel data, and constructs an `Image` object. The `writeNetpbm` function writes the image dimensions and pixel data to the specified file. Both functions use type constraints to ensure compatibility with the specified color type.
