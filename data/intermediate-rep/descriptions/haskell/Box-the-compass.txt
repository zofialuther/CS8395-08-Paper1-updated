This code defines a list of compass directions and functions to convert between compass point names and degrees. The `dirs` list contains 32 compass directions, and the `pointName` function can be used to convert an index between 0 and 31 to the corresponding compass point name. The `pointIndex` function takes a degree value and calculates the corresponding compass point index. The `printPointName` function takes a degree value as input and prints the corresponding compass point name along with the degree value. Finally, the `main` function prints all 32 compass point names along with their corresponding degree values.
