The code defines a function `showExpansion` that takes a string as input and parses it using the Text.Parsec library. The parsed output is then formatted and returned as a string. The parser uses various parsing functions such as `expansion`, `alts`, `alt`, `alt1`, `sepBy2`, and `escape` to handle different types of input patterns. The `main` function calls `showExpansion` on a series of example strings and prints the parsed output to the console.
