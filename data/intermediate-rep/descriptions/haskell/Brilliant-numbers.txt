This code defines a program to identify and display "brilliant numbers," which are numbers with prime factor pairs that have the same number of digits. The `isBrilliant` function checks whether a given number is brilliant based on its prime factors, and the `main` function generates a list of brilliant numbers and displays them in a table format. The `table` function is used to format the output into a visually appealing table. The program also includes a test section to verify the correctness of the brilliant number identification.
