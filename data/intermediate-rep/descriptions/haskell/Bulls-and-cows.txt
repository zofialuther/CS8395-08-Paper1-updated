This code is a simple implementation of the game "Bulls and Cows" in Haskell. The game generates a random sequence of four unique digits and prompts the player to guess the sequence. The player's input is then scored based on the number of correct digits in the correct position (bulls) and the number of correct digits in the wrong position (cows). The game continues until the player guesses the correct sequence. The 'pick' function is used to randomly select items from a list without replacement.
