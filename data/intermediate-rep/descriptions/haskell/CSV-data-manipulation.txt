This code defines functions for manipulating data in a delimited format. It includes functions for splitting a string into fields based on specified delimiters, converting a list of lists of strings into a 2D array, reading and writing data from/to files, making changes to the data in the array, and executing the entire process in the main function. The code uses various functions from the Data.Array, Data.List, Control.Monad, and Data.Maybe modules to perform these operations. The main function reads data from "example.txt", makes some changes to it, and writes the modified data to "output.txt".
