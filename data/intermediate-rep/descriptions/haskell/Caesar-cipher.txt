The code defines a module called "Caesar" that contains two functions, "caesar" and "uncaesar". The "caesar" function takes an integral value "k" and a string, and applies the Caesar cipher to the string by shifting each letter in the string by the value of "k". The "uncaesar" function reverses the Caesar cipher by applying the negative value of "k" to the string. The code also includes a helper function called "addChar" that performs the character shifting for the Caesar cipher.
