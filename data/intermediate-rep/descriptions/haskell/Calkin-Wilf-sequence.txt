This code contains functions to generate and manipulate the Calkin-Wilf sequence, which is a sequence of rational numbers. It includes functions to calculate the index of a given rational number in the sequence, as well as to represent a rational number as a continued fraction and ensure that the continued fraction has an odd length. The main function demonstrates the use of these functions by printing the first 20 numbers in the Calkin-Wilf sequence and finding the index of a specific rational number in the sequence.
