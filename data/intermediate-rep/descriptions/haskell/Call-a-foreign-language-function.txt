This code is written in Haskell and makes use of foreign function interface to call a C function. The code imports the strdup function from the C library "string.h" and uses it to duplicate a C string. It then marshalls the C string back into a Haskell string and prints it. Finally, the memory allocated for the duplicated C string is freed. This demonstrates how to interact with C code from within Haskell.
