This code is written in Haskell and uses the Data.Numbers.Primes library to generate a list of Carmichael numbers. It iterates through a range of prime numbers, performs calculations and checks for specific conditions to determine if a number is a Carmichael number. Once a Carmichael number is found, it is returned as a tuple of three values (p, q, r). The main function then prints the list of Carmichael numbers to the console.
