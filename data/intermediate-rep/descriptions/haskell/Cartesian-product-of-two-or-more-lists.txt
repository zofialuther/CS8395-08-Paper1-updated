This code is a Haskell program that defines a main function using the IO monad. Within the main function, it uses the cartProdN function to compute the Cartesian product of multiple lists of integers and then prints the results to the console. The cartProdN function takes a list of lists as input and returns the Cartesian product of those lists. The code demonstrates the use of the cartProdN function with different input lists, including cases where one of the lists is empty.
