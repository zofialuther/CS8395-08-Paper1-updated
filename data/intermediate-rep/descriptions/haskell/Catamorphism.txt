This code imports the Monoid module and defines a main function that performs a series of operations on a list of numbers. It uses the foldr function and the Monoid typeclass to calculate the sum, product, and concatenate the elements of the list. It then prints the results using putStrLn and unlines. The code also demonstrates the use of the Sum and Product data constructors to perform monoidal operations on the list. Finally, it applies the foldr function to a list of strings and prints the concatenated result.
