This code is a program that handles client connections and communication using mutexes for synchronization. The main procedure sets up a mutex and a set for storing client connections, and then enters a loop to handle incoming client connections. When a client connects, the handle_client procedure is called to manage the client communication. Within handle_client, the program uses mutexes to safely update the number of active connections and manage the client set. The program also uses threads to handle client communication asynchronously. Overall, the code provides a robust system for handling multiple client connections and ensuring safe concurrent access to shared resources.
