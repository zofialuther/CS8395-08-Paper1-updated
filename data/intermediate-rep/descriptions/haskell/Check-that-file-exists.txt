This code defines a function called "check" that takes a function and a file path as arguments, and then checks if the file path exists using the provided function. If the file path exists, it prints a message saying so, and if it does not exist, it prints a message saying it does not exist. The "main" function then calls the "check" function multiple times with different file paths and functions to check if they exist.
