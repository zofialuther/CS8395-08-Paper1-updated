This code is a Haskell program that generates traditional Chinese calendar information for a given year. It includes arrays for traditional strings and cycles, as well as functions to display the information for specific years. The 'main' function is used to test the program by displaying the calendar information for a list of years. The 'showYear' function formats and justifies the output for each year.
