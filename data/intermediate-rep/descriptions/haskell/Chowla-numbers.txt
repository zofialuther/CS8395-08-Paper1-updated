This code calculates the Chowla function for a given number, which is the sum of the factors of the prime factorization of the number. It also computes the number of primes and perfect numbers within specified ranges. The code uses parallel processing to optimize performance, and the results are printed with informative messages. The main function sets the number of cores to be used and then executes the computations and prints the results.
