This code imports various modules and defines functions to find the closest pair of points in a list of 2D coordinates. The `vecLeng` function calculates the distance between two points using the Euclidean distance formula. The `findClosestPair` function uses a combination of `foldl`, `minimumBy`, and `concatMap` to find the pair of points with the smallest distance between them. The `testCP` function generates a list of random points and then finds and prints the closest pair using the `findClosestPair` function. Finally, the `main` function calls `testCP` to execute the closest pair of points algorithm.
