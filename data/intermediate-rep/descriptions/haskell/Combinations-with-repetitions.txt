This code defines a function called combinationsWithRepetition that takes an integer k and a list of elements xs, and returns a list of lists containing all possible combinations of length k with repetition allowed. The function uses recursion to generate the combinations and handles cases where k is 0 or when the input list is empty. The code also includes a test function main that demonstrates the use of combinationsWithRepetition with different input values.
