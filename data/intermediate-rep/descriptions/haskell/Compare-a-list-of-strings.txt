The code defines two functions, allEq and allInc, which take a list of elements and return a boolean value. The allEq function checks if all elements in the list are equal using the Eq typeclass, while the allInc function checks if all elements in the list are in increasing order using the Ord typeclass. Both functions use the until function to repeatedly apply a transformation to the list until a certain condition is met, and return True if the condition is satisfied, and False otherwise.
