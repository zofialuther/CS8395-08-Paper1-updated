This code is a simple lexer written in Haskell. It defines a set of tokens that can be recognized in a given input string and processes the input to generate a list of tokens. The tokens include integers, strings, identifiers, keywords, operators, and symbols. The main function reads input from a file or standard input, processes it using the lexer, and prints the resulting tokens along with their locations. The code uses the `Control.Monad.State.Lazy` and `Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe` libraries to manage the lexer state and handle potential failures. The `Data.Text` library is used to work with text data efficiently. The code also includes error handling to report lexing errors and unknown characters. Overall, this code provides a foundation for building a lexical analyzer for a simple programming language.
