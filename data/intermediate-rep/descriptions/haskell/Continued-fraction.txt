This code includes functions to convert continued fractions to rational numbers, to truncate continued fractions after a certain number of terms or when the error is at most 1/p, and to convert continued fractions to decimal strings with a specified number of digits after the decimal point. The main function prints out the decimal representations of the square root of 2, Euler's number (Napier), and a custom pie sequence, each truncated to 200 digits.
