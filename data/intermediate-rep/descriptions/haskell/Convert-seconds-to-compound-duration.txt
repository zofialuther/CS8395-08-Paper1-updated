This code defines a function called `durationString` that generates a compound duration string based on the input parameters. It uses helper functions such as `timeTags` and `weekParts` to calculate and format the duration components. Additionally, there is a `translation` function that provides a test case for the `durationString` function. The `main` function runs a series of test cases using different input parameters and prints the results. Overall, this code is designed to handle and format compound duration strings based on specified duration components.
