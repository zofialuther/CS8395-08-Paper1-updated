This code defines a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life. It includes functions for creating a grid of cells, printing the grid to the console, and simulating the game for a specified number of generations. The `grid` function takes a list of strings representing the initial state of the grid and converts it into a 2D array. The `printGrid` function prints the grid to the console, using '.' to represent dead cells and '#' to represent live cells. The `printLife` function simulates the game for a specified number of generations and prints each generation to the console. Finally, the `main` function sets up and runs the simulation with the initial state defined by the `glider` variable.
