This code defines a function 'count' which takes an integer and a list of integers as input and returns the number of ways the given integer can be represented using the values in the list. It uses recursion and list comprehension to calculate the count for different combinations of values. The 'main' function demonstrates the usage of the 'count' function by finding the number of ways to represent 100 using the values 1, 5, 10, and 25.
