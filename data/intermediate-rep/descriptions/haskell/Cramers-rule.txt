This code is a Haskell program that performs various matrix operations. It includes functions for calculating permutations, matrix multiplication, finding the determinant of a matrix, solving linear equations using Cramer's rule, and more. The 'task' function is used to demonstrate the functionality by solving a specific matrix equation and performing various validations. Finally, the 'main' function initializes sample input matrices and calls the 'task' function to showcase the program's capabilities.
