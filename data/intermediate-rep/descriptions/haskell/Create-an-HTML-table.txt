This code defines a function makeTable that takes a list of headings, the number of rows, and a random number generator as input, and generates an HTML table with the specified headings and random data. The main function uses getStdGen to get a random number generator and then uses the makeTable function to create a table with headings "X", "Y", and "Z" and 3 rows of random data. The resulting HTML table is then printed to the console in a pretty format.
