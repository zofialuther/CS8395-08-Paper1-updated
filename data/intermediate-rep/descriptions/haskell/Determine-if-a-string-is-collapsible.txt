This code includes two functions for working with strings. The first function, isCollapsible, takes a string and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any consecutive duplicate characters in the string. The second function, collapsed, takes a string and returns a new string with consecutive duplicate characters collapsed into a single character. Both functions use the group function from the Data.List module to group consecutive duplicate characters together.
