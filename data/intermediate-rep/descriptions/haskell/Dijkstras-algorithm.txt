This code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a given weighted graph represented as an adjacency list. The `dijkstra` function takes the source vertex, an invalid index, and the adjacency list as input and returns the minimum distance and previous vertex arrays. The `shortest_path_to` function uses the previous vertex array to find the shortest path to a target vertex. The provided example uses a graph represented as an adjacency list and calculates the shortest path from vertex 'a' to vertex 'e', displaying the distance and the path.
