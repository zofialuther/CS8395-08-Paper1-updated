This code implements a logic puzzle known as the "Dinesman problem" using Haskell. The problem involves determining the floor on which each of five people (Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith) lives in a five-floor apartment building, based on a set of given constraints. The code uses list permutations and guards to generate and filter all possible combinations of floor assignments until it finds a valid solution. The main function then prints out the first valid solution as well as all valid solutions.
