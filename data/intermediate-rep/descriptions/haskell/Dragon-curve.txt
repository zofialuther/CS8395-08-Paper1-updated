This code defines a recursive function to generate a string representing a specific pattern. The 'dragon' function takes a parameter 'n' and uses it to create a string based on the values of 'x' and 'y' calculated by the other functions. The main function then prints the result of calling 'dragon' with the value 14. The resulting string is a sequence of commands for drawing a pattern using specific coordinates and rotations.
