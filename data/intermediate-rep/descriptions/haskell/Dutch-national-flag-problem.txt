This code defines a program that simulates the Dutch national flag problem. It includes a data type for colors, a function to sort a list of colors in the order red, white, blue, and a function to check if a given list is already sorted according to the Dutch national flag colors. The program also generates a random sequence of colors, checks if it is already sorted according to the Dutch national flag, and if not, sorts it and displays the original and sorted sequences.
