This code creates a variable called var-name and assigns it the value "hello". Then it uses the eval function to evaluate the string "(var " followed by the value of var-name and ")" as code, effectively retrieving the value of the variable var-name. Finally, it passes the retrieved value (in this case, "hello") as an argument to a function or procedure, along with the integer 123.
