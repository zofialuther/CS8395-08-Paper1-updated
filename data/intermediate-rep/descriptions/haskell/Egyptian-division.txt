This code defines a function called egyptianQuotRem that takes two integers as input and returns a tuple of their quotient and remainder. The function uses the unfoldr function from the Data.List module to generate a series of doubling rows based on the input numbers. It then refolds these rows to calculate the quotient and remainder. The main function calls egyptianQuotRem with specific inputs and prints the result. The trace function is used to print intermediate steps and debug information.
