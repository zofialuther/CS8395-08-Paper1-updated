This code is a Haskell program that takes a directory path as a command line argument and checks if the directory is empty. It does this by using the getDirectoryContents function to get a list of files and directories in the specified path, and then checks if the list only contains the current directory (.) and parent directory (..). If it does, it returns "Directory is empty", otherwise it returns "Directory is not empty". The main function takes the command line argument, applies the isEmpty function to it, and prints the result to the console.
