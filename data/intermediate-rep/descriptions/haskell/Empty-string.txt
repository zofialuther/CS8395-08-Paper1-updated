This Haskell code demonstrates how to use the 'null' function on lists (in this case, a string) to check if it is empty. It uses the 'Control.Monad' module to conditionally print "Empty." if the string is empty and "Not empty." if it is not. The code emphasizes the use of 'null' over 'length' for efficiency, particularly with the ability to handle infinite lists in Haskell.
