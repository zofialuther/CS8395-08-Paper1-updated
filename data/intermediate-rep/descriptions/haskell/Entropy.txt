This code calculates the entropy of a given input string "1223334444" using the Shannon entropy formula. The entropy function first calculates the frequency of each unique character in the string, then uses these frequencies to calculate the entropy value. The main function prints the result of the entropy calculation. The code uses functions from the Data.List module such as group, sort, and genericLength, as well as mathematical operations like sum and map. The entropy function takes a list of sortable elements and returns a floating-point number representing the entropy value.
