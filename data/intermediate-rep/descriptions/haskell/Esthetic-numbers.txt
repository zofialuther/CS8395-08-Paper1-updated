This code defines functions to work with esthetic numbers, which are numbers that have all absolute differences of consecutive digits equal to 1 in a given base. The code includes a monadic solution that is inefficient for small bases and a more efficient iterative solution translated from Python. It also includes functions for converting numbers to and from a given base, as well as a function to represent numbers in a given base. The code utilizes list manipulation and monadic operations to achieve its functionality.
