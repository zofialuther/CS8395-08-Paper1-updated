This code implements the Ethiopian multiplication algorithm, which is a method for multiplying two numbers using only addition, doubling, and halving. The `ethMult` function takes an integer `n` and a monoid `m`, and returns the result of multiplying `n` by `m` using the Ethiopian multiplication algorithm. The `half` function halves a number, and the `addedWhereOdd` function adds `x` to `a` if `d` is odd. The `main` function includes test cases for the `ethMult` function, demonstrating its use with different types of monoids and integer inputs.
