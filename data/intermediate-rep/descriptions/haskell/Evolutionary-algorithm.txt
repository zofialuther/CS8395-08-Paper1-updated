This code is a simulation of the genetic algorithm known as "The Weasel Program," famously used by Richard Dawkins to demonstrate the power of natural selection. The program starts with a random population of strings and evolves them over generations to match a target phrase. The code uses random number generation, array manipulation, and functional programming techniques to simulate the process of mutation, selection, and reproduction. The program prints the best fit string after a certain number of generations and continues until the target phrase is achieved.
