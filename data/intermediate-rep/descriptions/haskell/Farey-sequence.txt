This code defines functions to generate and manipulate Farey sequences, which are sequences of rational numbers in a given range. The 'farey' function generates the n'th order Farey sequence, while the 'fareys' function applies a given function to the highest order Farey sequence and then successively prunes the sequence to generate the lower order sequences. The 'fprint' function formats and prints the results, and the 'showFracs' function converts a list of rational numbers into a string format. The 'main' function demonstrates the usage of these functions by printing the Farey sequences and their lengths for a range of orders.
