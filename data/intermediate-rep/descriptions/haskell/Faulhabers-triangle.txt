This code defines a function to calculate the Faulhaber polynomial with a given power and a rational number as input. It also includes functions to display the results in a formatted triangle and to calculate the maximum widths of the rational numbers in the triangle for proper alignment. The main function demonstrates the usage of these functions by displaying the Faulhaber triangle and calculating the 17th Faulhaber polynomial for the input value of 1000.
