This code defines functions to find the common prefix of two lists, the common prefix of zero or more lists, split a string into path components, and then find the common prefix of zero or more paths. The main function uses these functions to find the common directory path of a list of paths and then prints the result. The common directory path is found by splitting each path into its components and then finding the common prefix among all the paths, with the caveat that a single "/" is not considered a path component.
