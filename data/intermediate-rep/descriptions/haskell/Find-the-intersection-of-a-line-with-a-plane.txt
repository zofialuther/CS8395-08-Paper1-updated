This code defines a 3-dimensional vector data type and implements Functor, Applicative, and Num instances for it. It also includes functions for calculating the dot product of two vectors and finding the intersection of a ray and a plane in 3D space. The main function uses these functions to find the intersection point of a given ray and plane and prints the result using printf.
