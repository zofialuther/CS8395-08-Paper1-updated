This code defines a series of functions for performing mathematical operations. The `cube` function raises a given number to the power of 3, while the `croot` function calculates the cube root of a number. The `funclist` and `invlist` lists contain various trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, respectively. The `main` function uses the `zipWith` function to apply a composition of functions from `funclist` and `invlist` to the number 0.5, and then prints the result.
