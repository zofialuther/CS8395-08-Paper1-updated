This code is designed to identify the months in a given range of years (1900-2100) that have five weekends (i.e., months where the first day falls on a Friday and has 31 days). It also determines the number of "lean" years within the range, which are years that do not have any months with five weekends. The code then displays the total number of five-weekend months, the first and last five, the number of lean years, and the specific lean years.
