This code generates and prints a list of the first 100 FizzBuzz values. It combines the numbers from 1 to 100 with the corresponding FizzBuzz values, where numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Fizz" and numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Buzz". If a number is not divisible by 3 or 5, it simply prints the number. The `mapM_` function is used to print each FizzBuzz value on a new line.
