This code defines a data structure called NestedList, which can contain either a list of NestedList elements or an individual Entry. It also includes a function called flatten that takes a NestedList and returns a flattened list of its elements. The example function demonstrates how to use NestedList by creating a nested structure and then flattening it. The main function prints the flattened list of the example NestedList.
