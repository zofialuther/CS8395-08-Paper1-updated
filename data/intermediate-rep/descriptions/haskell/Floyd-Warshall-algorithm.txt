This code implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph. It uses a fold operation to iterate through all vertices and update the distance matrix accordingly. The innerCycle function calculates the new distance between two vertices by considering the distance through a third vertex. Finally, the setTo function updates the distance matrix by combining the previous distances with the newly calculated ones.
