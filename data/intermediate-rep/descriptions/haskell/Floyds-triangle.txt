This code generates and prints the first few levels of Floyd's Triangle, a right-angled triangular array of natural numbers. The `floyd` function calculates each row of the triangle based on the previous row, and the `floyds` function uses `iterate` to generate an infinite list of these rows. The `main` function tests the code by printing the first 5 and 14 levels of Floyd's Triangle.
