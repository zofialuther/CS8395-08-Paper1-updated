This code uses the HGL library to create a graphical representation of a fractal tree. It generates a tree with a specified number of levels and displays it in a window. The tree is constructed using a mathematical algorithm that calculates the coordinates of the tree's branches and then uses polyline to draw them on the screen. The main function calls the fractalTree function with the desired number of levels to create the tree.
