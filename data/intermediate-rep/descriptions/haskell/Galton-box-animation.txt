This code implements a simulation of a Galton box, a device used for statistical experiments. It models the movement of balls through a series of pins and counting bins. The `Ball` data type represents a ball's position and its turns, and the `World` type represents the state of the simulation. The `updateWorld` function updates the state of the world as the balls move through the system. The `drawWorld` function creates a visual representation of the world. The `startSimulation` function initiates the simulation and the `main` function runs the simulation with a specified number of rows and random turns for the balls. Overall, the code simulates the Galton box and provides a visual representation of the experiment's results.
