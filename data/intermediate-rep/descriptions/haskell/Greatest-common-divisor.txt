This code defines a function called "gcd" that takes two integer parameters and returns their greatest common divisor. The function first takes the absolute values of the input parameters and then uses a helper function called "gcd_" to calculate the greatest common divisor recursively using the Euclidean algorithm. The base case of the recursion is when the second parameter is 0, in which case the first parameter is returned.
