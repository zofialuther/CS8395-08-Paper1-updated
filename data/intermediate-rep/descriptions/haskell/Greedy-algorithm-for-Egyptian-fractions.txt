This code defines a function called egyptianFraction that takes a rational number as input and returns a list of rational numbers representing its Egyptian fraction representation. An Egyptian fraction is a representation of a rational number as a sum of distinct unit fractions (fractions with 1 in the numerator). The function handles both positive and negative input numbers, and uses the numerator and denominator functions from the Data.Ratio module to extract the numerator and denominator of the input rational number. The function then uses a series of conditional statements and calculations to construct the Egyptian fraction representation of the input number.
