This code is a simple guessing game where the user is prompted to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. The program will repeatedly prompt the user to enter a number until the input starts with a number. Once a valid number is entered, the program will compare it to the secret number and provide feedback (e.g. "Too high. Guess again.") based on the user's input. This process will continue until the user guesses the correct number, at which point the program will display "You got it!" and end.
