This code defines functions to generate and analyze Hailstone sequences, which are sequences of numbers generated by a specific mathematical process. The collatz function calculates the next number in the sequence based on whether the current number is even or odd. The hailstone function generates the entire sequence for a given starting number. The longestChain function calculates the starting number with the longest Hailstone sequence among the numbers from 1 to 100000. The main function tests the functionality of the code by displaying the Hailstone sequence for 27, identifying the number with the longest sequence, and displaying the length of that sequence.
