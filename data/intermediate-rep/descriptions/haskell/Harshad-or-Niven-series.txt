This code generates a list of Harshad numbers, which are positive integers that are divisible by the sum of their digits. The `harshads` function uses `filter` and a combination of `rem` and `digitSum` functions to generate the list. The `digitSum` function calculates the sum of the digits of an integer using `unfoldr` and `bool`. The `main` function then prints the first 20 Harshad numbers and the first Harshad number greater than 1000.
