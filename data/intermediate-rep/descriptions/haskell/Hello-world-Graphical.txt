This code creates a simple GTK message dialog that displays the message "Goodbye, World!" and a single "OK" button. It uses the GTK library to initialize the GUI and create the dialog. It sets up a response handler to close the dialog when the "OK" button is clicked or when the dialog is closed. Finally, it starts the main GUI loop to display the dialog and wait for user interaction.
