This code implements Huffman encoding, a lossless data compression algorithm. It defines a data type for a Huffman tree, as well as functions for serializing the tree, constructing the Huffman tree from a list of frequency-weighted elements, and generating the frequency of elements in a list. The main function demonstrates the use of the Huffman encoding by encoding a test string and printing the encoded symbols.
