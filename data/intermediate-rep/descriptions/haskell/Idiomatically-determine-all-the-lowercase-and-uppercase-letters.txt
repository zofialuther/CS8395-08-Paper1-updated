This code generates a list of all uppercase and lowercase letters in the English alphabet. It uses various functions from different modules to filter and partition the characters based on their case. The result is then formatted and printed as separate lists of uppercase and lowercase letters. The code is tested by printing the results in chunks of 70 characters.
