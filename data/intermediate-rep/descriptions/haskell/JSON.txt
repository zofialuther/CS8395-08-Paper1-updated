This code is written in Haskell and uses the OverloadedStrings language extension. It imports modules for working with JSON data and text parsing. The main function creates a JSON object with various data types and then encodes it into a lazy bytestring. It then attempts to parse the bytestring back into JSON and compares the result with the original object. If the parsed JSON is not equal to the original object, it will print an error message. If they are equal, it will print the parsed JSON.
