This code implements a solution to the knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The knapsack function takes a list of items, each with a weight, value, and quantity, as well as a capacity limit. It then calculates the optimal combination of items to maximize value within the given capacity. The main function uses this knapsack function to find the optimal solution for a specific inventory with a capacity of 400.
