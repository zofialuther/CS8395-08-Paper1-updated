This code is a solution for the knapsack problem, where the goal is to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack without exceeding the weight capacity. The code defines a list of items with their respective values and weights. It then sorts the items by their value-to-weight ratio using the sortBy function. The solution function takes a knapsack capacity and the list of items as input and uses a loop to determine which items to take based on their weight and value. The main function calls the solution function with a knapsack capacity of 15 and the list of items.
