This code implements the Knight's Tour problem, which is a mathematical puzzle that requires the knight in chess to visit every square on the board exactly once. The `knightTour` function uses backtracking to find a sequence of moves for the knight to achieve this. The `knightOptions` function calculates all possible legal moves for the knight from a given square. The code also includes a `main` function that takes a starting point in algebraic notation (e.g., "e5") and prints out the sequence of knight's moves in algebraic notation until all squares on the board have been visited.
