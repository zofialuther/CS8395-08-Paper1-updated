This code is a Haskell implementation of the Koch Snowflake curve, a fractal curve with self-similar properties. It includes functions to generate the Koch curve and the equilateral apex, as well as functions to handle rotations and SVG generation. The main function demonstrates the use of the kochSnowflake function to generate a Koch Snowflake with 4 iterations and then outputs it as an SVG image.
