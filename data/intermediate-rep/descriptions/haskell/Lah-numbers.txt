This code defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number and another function to calculate the Lah numbers. Lah numbers are a generalization of the binomial coefficients. The code also includes a function to print the Lah numbers in a tabular format and a main function that demonstrates the use of the Lah number calculation function. The main function prints the Lah numbers for a range of values and then calculates and prints the maximum value from the L(100, *) row of Lah numbers.
