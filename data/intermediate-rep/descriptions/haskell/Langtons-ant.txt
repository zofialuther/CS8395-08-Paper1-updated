This code defines a function `step` that takes a `State` object and returns a new `State` object. The function checks if the current position of the state is black, and if it is, it updates the state by setting it to white, turning right, and moving forward. If the position is not black, it sets it to black, turns left, and moves forward. The `State` object contains information about the current position, direction, and a set of black positions. The functions `isBlack`, `setBlack`, `setWhite`, `turnRight`, `turnLeft`, and `move` are helper functions that modify the state based on the given conditions.
