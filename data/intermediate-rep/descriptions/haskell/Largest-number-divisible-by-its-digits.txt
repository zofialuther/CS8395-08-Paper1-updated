This code defines a function to calculate the least common multiple of the numbers from 1 to 15. It then calculates an upper limit by subtracting the remainder of a large hexadecimal number divided by the least common multiple. Finally, it uses the upper limit to filter and print a list of hexadecimal numbers that have a length of 15 unique digits when represented in hexadecimal form.
