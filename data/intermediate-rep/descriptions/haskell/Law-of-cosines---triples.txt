This code defines a function that generates triangles based on a given map of integer values. The function takes a map and four integer values as input, and returns a list of tuples representing the sides of valid triangles. The code also includes tests for different scenarios, such as triangles with maximum side 13 and triangles with uneven sides of maximum length 10000 at a 60-degree angle. The code demonstrates the use of Data.Map.Strict, Data.Set, and Data.Monoid in Haskell programming.
