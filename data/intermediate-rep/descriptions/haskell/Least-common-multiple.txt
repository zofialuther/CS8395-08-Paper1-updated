This code defines a function called "lcm" that takes two integral numbers as input and calculates their least common multiple (LCM). It first checks for the special cases where one or both of the input numbers are zero and returns 0 in those cases. For non-zero inputs, it calculates the LCM using the formula abs ((x `quot` (gcd x y)) * y), where x and y are the input numbers and gcd is the greatest common divisor function. The result is the absolute value of the product of the two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor.
