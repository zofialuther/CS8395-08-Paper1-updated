This code defines a left factorial function 'leftFact' that calculates the cumulative sum of factorials using the scanl function. It also defines a factorial function 'fact' using the scanl function to calculate the cumulative product of numbers from 1 onwards. The main function uses the leftFact function to display the cumulative sums for the numbers 0 to 10, and then displays the cumulative sums for numbers in the range 20 to 110 by tens. Finally, it calculates and displays the length of the cumulative sums for numbers in the range 1,000 to 10,000 by thousands.
