This code defines a function called levenshtein that calculates the Levenshtein distance between two input lists. The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into another. The function uses recursion and pattern matching to compare the input lists and calculate the distance. The main function calls levenshtein with the example input "kitten" and "sitting" and prints the result.
