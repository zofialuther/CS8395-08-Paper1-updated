This code defines a function `longPrimesUpTo` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of prime numbers less than `n` that satisfy a certain condition. It uses a sieve algorithm to generate prime numbers and checks if each number is a "long prime". The `display` function prints the number of long primes for increasing values of `n` up to 64,000. The `main` function demonstrates the use of `longPrimesUpTo` and outputs the long primes up to 500, as well as the number of long primes up to 500.
