This code defines a function lcs that takes two input strings and returns the longest common subsequence. The function uses the maximumBy function from Data.Ord to find the longest subsequence by comparing their lengths. It also uses the intersect function from Data.List to find the common subsequences between the input strings. The main function then calls lcs with the input strings "thisisatest" and "testing123testing" and prints the result.
