The code defines a function called `longestCommon` which takes two lists as input and returns the longest common substring between the two lists. The function uses the `intersect` function from the `Data.List` module to find the common elements between the two lists. It then uses `maximumBy` and `comparing` from the `Data.Ord` module to find the longest common substring. The `main` function tests the `longestCommon` function by passing two strings as input and printing the result.
