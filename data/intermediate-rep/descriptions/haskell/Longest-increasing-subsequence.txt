The given code is a Haskell program that implements the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. The `lis` function takes a list of ordered elements and returns the longest subsequence of unique, increasing elements. It uses the `subsequences` function to generate all possible subsequences, then filters for those that are sorted and unique, and finally selects the longest one. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `lis` function by printing the results for three different input lists.
