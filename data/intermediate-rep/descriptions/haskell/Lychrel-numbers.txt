This code defines a module with functions to process Lychrel numbers. The procLychrel function generates a list of Lychrel numbers based on a given starting integer, while isPalindrome checks if a number is a palindrome. The isLychrel function determines if a given number is a Lychrel number. The reverseInteger function reverses the digits of an integer. The seedAndRelated function calculates various statistics and lists related to Lychrel numbers within a range of 1 to 10,000. Finally, the main function prints out the total count of Lychrel numbers, palindromic Lychrel numbers, Lychrel seeds, and related Lychrel numbers.
