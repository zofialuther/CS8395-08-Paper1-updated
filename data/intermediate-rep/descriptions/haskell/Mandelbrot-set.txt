The code consists of multiple attempts to generate a visual representation of the Mandelbrot set using Haskell. Each attempt builds upon the previous one, with changes such as replacing iterate with foldr, modifying the output characters, and using different functions and operators. The final version uses mapM_ instead of foldr, the bind operator instead of list comprehension, and lambda functions instead of let expressions. The code can be copied and pasted into GHCI to visualize the Mandelbrot set.
