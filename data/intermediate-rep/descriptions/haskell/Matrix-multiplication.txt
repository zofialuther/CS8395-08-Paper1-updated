This code defines a function called "multiply" that takes two lists of lists of numbers and returns a new list of lists of numbers that is the result of matrix multiplication. The "main" function demonstrates the use of the "multiply" function by multiplying two example matrices and printing the result. The multiplication is performed using the map and zipWith functions to iterate through the input matrices and calculate the individual elements of the result matrix.
