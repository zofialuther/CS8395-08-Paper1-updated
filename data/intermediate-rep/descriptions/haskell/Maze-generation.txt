This code generates and prints a maze using a randomized algorithm. The `maze` function creates a maze of a specified width and height. The maze is represented by two sets of walls - rightWalls and belowWalls. The algorithm uses a random number generator to determine the layout of the maze. The `printMaze` function then prints the maze to the console. The `main` function initializes the random number generator and generates a maze of size 11x8, and then prints it.
