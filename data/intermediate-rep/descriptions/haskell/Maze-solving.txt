This Haskell code consists of functions to solve a maze represented as a list of strings. The "average" function calculates the average of two points, "notBlocked" checks if a wall position in the maze is not blocked, "substitute" substitutes an element at a given position in a list, and "draw" draws a '*' at a given position in the maze. The "tryMoves" function attempts different moves in the maze and returns the solved maze if possible. The "solve_" function recursively attempts to solve the maze by exploring different positions. Finally, the "solve" function initiates the solving process from the lower-right corner to the upper-left corner of the maze. The "main" function takes an unsolved maze as input and prints the solved maze as output.
