The code in the RosettaSelect module allows the user to select an item from a list of strings. The select function takes a list of strings as input and prompts the user to choose an item from the list. The showMenu function displays the list of items with corresponding numbers for the user to choose from. The choose function validates the user's input and returns the selected item as a Maybe type. The code also includes a helper function maybeRead to convert user input to the appropriate type. Overall, this module provides a user-friendly interface for selecting items from a list.
