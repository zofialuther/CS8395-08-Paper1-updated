This code is a program that reads data from two CSV files ("patients.csv" and "visits.csv"), combines the data, and then displays it in a tabulated format. The tabulated data includes information such as patient ID, last name, visit date, sum of scores, and average score. The code uses functions to manipulate and format the data, and ultimately outputs the tabulated data to the console. The tabulation process involves transposing and padding the data, as well as calculating the maximum width for each column.
