This code implements functions to calculate the MÃ¶bius function, the Mertens function, and then uses these functions to analyze and print the results for the first 99 terms of the Mertens function. It also counts the number of times the Mertens function is zero and the number of times it crosses zero for the range of 1 to 1000. The code utilizes memoization and various mathematical libraries to efficiently perform these calculations and analyses. The main function prints the results in a formatted manner.
