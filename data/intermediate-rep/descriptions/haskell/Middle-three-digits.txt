This code defines a function called "mid3" that takes an integer and returns either an error message or the middle three digits of the absolute value of the input number. If the number is too small or has an even number of digits, an error message is returned. Otherwise, the middle three digits are extracted and returned as a string. The code also includes a test section that applies the "mid3" function to a list of numbers and prints the results, along with a function called "justifyRight" that pads a string with a specified character to a given length.
