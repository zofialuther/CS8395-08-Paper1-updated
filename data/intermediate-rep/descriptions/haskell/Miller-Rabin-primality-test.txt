This module, "Primes", provides a pure function "isPrime" that checks whether a given integer is a prime number using the Miller-Rabin primality test. The Miller-Rabin test is nearly deterministic and uses a set of witnesses to determine primality. The code also includes functions for generating these witnesses and for performing modular exponentiation efficiently. The "isPrime" function uses the "isMillerRabinPrime" function, which in turn utilizes the "witnesses" function to generate the necessary witnesses for the Miller-Rabin test. Additionally, the module includes a list of prime numbers up to 100 and a function for calculating modular exponentiation.
