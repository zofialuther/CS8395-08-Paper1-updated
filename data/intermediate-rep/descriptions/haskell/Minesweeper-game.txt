The code defines a Haskell module for a Minesweeper game, including data types and functions for managing the game board and cell states. It uses TemplateHaskell for automatic lens and prism generation. The board is represented as a list of cells, and functions are provided for opening cells, flagging cells, checking for win or loss conditions, and displaying the game board. Additionally, the code includes IO functions for generating a mine board with random mine placement. The game board size and mine count are configurable.
