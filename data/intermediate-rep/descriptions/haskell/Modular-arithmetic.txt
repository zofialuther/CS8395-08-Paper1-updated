This code uses GHC extensions to enhance the functionality of the program, allowing for the use of / as an operator and 13 as a literal at the type level. The program also utilizes the Data.Modular library, which provides the Zahlen (â„¤) symbol as a synonym for Integer. The main function defines a mathematical function f that takes a Z modulo 13 as input and returns a Z modulo 13 as output. The function f calculates the result of x raised to the power of 100, adds x, and then adds 1. The main function then calls the function f with the input value 10 and prints the result.
