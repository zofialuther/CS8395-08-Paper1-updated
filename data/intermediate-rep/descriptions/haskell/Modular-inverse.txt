The given code includes a function called modInv which takes two integers a and m as input and returns Just x if there exists a value x such that ax is congruent to 1 mod m. If no such x exists, the function returns Nothing. The code utilizes the Extended Euclidean algorithm to calculate the modular inverse. The main function demonstrates the use of modInv by applying it to two different input pairs and printing the results.
