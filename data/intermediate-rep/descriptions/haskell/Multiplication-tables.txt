This code creates a multiplication table with optional values using the Maybe type. It defines a function mulTable that takes a list of integers and returns a 2D list with the multiplication table, where each element is wrapped in a Maybe. The upper triangular part of the table is filled with Just values, while the lower triangular part is filled with Nothing. It also includes a test function main that prints the multiplication table for different ranges of numbers. The showTable function is responsible for formatting and displaying the table.
