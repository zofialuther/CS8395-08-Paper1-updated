This code is a Haskell program that imports the Data.ByteString module and the Data.Bits module. It defines a main function that writes a file called "out.pgm" using the writeFile and pack functions from Data.ByteString. The content of the file is generated by converting a string "P5\n256 256\n256\n" to a list of integers, then performing a bitwise XOR operation on pairs of numbers ranging from 0 to 255. The resulting byte values are then packed into the output file.
