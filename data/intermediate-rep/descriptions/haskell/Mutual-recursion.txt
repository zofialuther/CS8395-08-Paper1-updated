This code defines two functions, f and m, which are mutually recursive. The function f calculates the sequence of numbers by subtracting the result of m(n-1) from n, while the function m calculates the sequence by subtracting the result of f(n-1) from n. The main function then prints the sequences generated by f and m for the numbers 0 to 19.
