This code generates and prints all possible solutions for the eight queens puzzle, which involves placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The `queens` function uses a combination of list manipulation and filtering to generate all possible arrangements of queens on the board, and the `notDiag` function checks that no two queens are on the same diagonal. The main function then prints each arrangement to the console.
