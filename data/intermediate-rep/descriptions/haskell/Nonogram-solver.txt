This code is a program written in Haskell for solving nonograms, which are grid-based puzzles where the cells in the grid must be filled in or left blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. The program is divided into sections such as parsing, constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and printing. It reads a problem file, parses the contents, solves the problem using a constraint satisfaction problem approach, and then prints the solution. The CSP approach involves the use of monads, list transposition, and constraint-solving functions.
