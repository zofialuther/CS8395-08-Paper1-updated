This code defines a function `ordSuff` that takes an integer and appends the appropriate ordinal suffix to it (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd). It also creates an array `ordSuffs` containing the ordinal suffixes for numbers 0 to 9. The `printOrdSuffs` function takes a list of integers and prints their corresponding ordinal representations using the `ordSuff` function. The `main` function demonstrates the use of `printOrdSuffs` with different ranges of numbers.
