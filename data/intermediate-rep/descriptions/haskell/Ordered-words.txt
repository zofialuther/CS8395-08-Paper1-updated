This code reads in the contents of a file called "unixdict.txt" and filters out the words that are sorted in ascending order. It then finds the length of the longest sorted word and prints out all the words that are that length. The code utilizes the Control.Monad library to handle the file reading and uses functions like filter, foldr, and map to manipulate and analyze the data. Overall, the code is designed to find and display the longest sorted words from the input file.
