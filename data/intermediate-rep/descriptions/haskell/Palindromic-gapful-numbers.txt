This code defines functions to generate and filter palindromic gapful numbers. A gapful number is a number that is divisible by the concatenation of its first and last digit. The code includes functions to check if a number is gapful, generate palindromic numbers, filter numbers ending in a specific digit, and display sets of filtered numbers. The main function then uses these functions to display sets of palindromic gapful numbers ending in specific digits, such as the first 20, last 15 of the first 100, and last 10 of the first 1000.
