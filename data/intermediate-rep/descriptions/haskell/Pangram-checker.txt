This code defines a function called pangram that checks if a given string is a pangram, meaning it contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. It first converts the input string to lowercase using the toLower function and then uses the (\\) operator from Data.List to subtract the lowercase alphabet from the input string. If the resulting list is empty, the function returns True, indicating that the input is a pangram. The main function tests the pangram function with a sample input and prints the result.
