This code defines a function called "partitions" that takes two integer inputs and returns a list of integers. The function calculates the partitions of a given number into a specified number of summands. It uses prime numbers to generate the partitions and includes a test function to demonstrate its functionality. Additionally, there is a generic function called "justifyLeft" that left-justifies a string within a specified width.
