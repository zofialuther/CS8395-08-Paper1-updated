This code provides a utility for memoization, where the results of function calls are stored and retrieved for future use. It includes a data type 'Memo' and a function 'memo' that takes a Memo and a number, and recursively retrieves the result of a function call based on the number. The code also calculates partitions using the memoization utility, as well as a main function that prints the partition for the number 6666.
