This code defines a program that generates random passwords based on the specified options. The options include the length of the password, the number of passwords to generate, and whether to use only readable characters. The main function takes in the options and generates the specified number of passwords using the specified length and character sets. If the option for using only readable characters is enabled, it will exclude visually similar characters. The program then outputs the generated passwords.
