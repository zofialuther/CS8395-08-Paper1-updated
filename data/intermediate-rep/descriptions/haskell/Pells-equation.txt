This code defines a function called pell that takes an Integer as input and returns a tuple of two Integers. The function uses a recursive helper function called go to calculate the Pell equation solution for the given input. The Pell equation is a type of Diophantine equation that arises in number theory. The code uses a series of calculations and conditional checks to find the pair of integers that satisfy the Pell equation, and then returns them as the output.
