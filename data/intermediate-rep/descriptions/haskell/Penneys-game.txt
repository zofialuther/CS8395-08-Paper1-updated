This code is a simple coin tossing game where the user competes against the CPU. The user is prompted to pick 3 sides of a coin, either heads or tails, and then the CPU makes its choice. The sequence of the coin tosses is then evaluated, and the winner is determined based on the outcome. The game continues until the user decides to exit.
