This code defines a function called "isPerfect" that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the input number is a perfect number. The function first calculates a list of all the factors of the input number, then checks if the sum of these factors equals the input number. The "main" function then prints a list of all perfect numbers between 1 and 10000 using the "isPerfect" function.
