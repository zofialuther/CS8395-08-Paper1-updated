This code is a program that generates and prints the first 50 Pierpont primes of the first and second kinds, as well as the 250th Pierpont prime of each kind. It uses functions to calculate n-smooth numbers, merge lists, check for prime numbers, and generate Pierpont primes based on a given kind. The main function formats and prints the results using printf and other utility functions.
