This code defines the data types Pip and Suit to represent playing card values and suits, and a Card type to represent a combination of a value and a suit. It also includes functions to generate a full range of values for the Pip and Suit types, create a full deck of cards, and shuffle a list using a random number generator. The shuffle function uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm to randomly shuffle the list.
