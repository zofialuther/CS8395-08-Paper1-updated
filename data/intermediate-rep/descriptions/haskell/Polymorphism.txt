This code defines two classes, Circle and Point, along with methods for creating copies of instances, printing instance representations, and setting field values during instance construction. The main procedure demonstrates the use of these classes by creating instances of Point and Circle, making copies, and accessing and modifying field values. The code provides a basic foundation for working with point and circle objects in a program.
