This code uses Haskell to calculate the frequency of pairs of prime numbers within a specified range. It imports necessary modules for data manipulation and prime number generation. The function 'freq' calculates the frequency of a given list of pairs, and the 'line' function prints the pairs, their count, and their frequency in a specified format. The 'main' function uses the 'groups' function to group and process prime numbers within a range, and then applies the 'line' function to each group.
