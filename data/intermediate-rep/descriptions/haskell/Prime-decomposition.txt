This code defines a function factorize that takes a number n and returns a list of its prime factors. It uses list comprehension to iterate through all numbers from 2 to n, checking if each number is a prime using the isPrime function. If the number is a prime factor of n, it is added to the list of factors. The divs function is used to recursively find all prime factors of n by dividing n by each prime factor and adding it to the list.
