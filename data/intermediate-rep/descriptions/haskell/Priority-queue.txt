This code defines a Priority Queue (PriorityQ) data structure and provides functions for operations such as creating an empty priority queue, checking if it's empty, getting the size, peeking the minimum value, pushing new elements, replacing the minimum value, deleting the minimum value, adjusting all elements, creating a priority queue from a list, merging two priority queues, popping the minimum value, and converting the priority queue to a sorted list. The implementation includes detailed comments explaining the time complexity of each function.
