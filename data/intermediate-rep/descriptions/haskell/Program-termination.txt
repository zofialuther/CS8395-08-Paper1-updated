This code uses the Control.Monad and System.Exit modules to handle different exit scenarios. The "when" function is used to execute different exit commands based on a given condition. If the condition "problem" is true, the code will exit with a success status or a specific failure status with an integer error code. The code also includes options for generic success and failure exits.
