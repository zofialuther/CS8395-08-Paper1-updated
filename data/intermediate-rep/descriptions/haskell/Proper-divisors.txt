This code includes a function to find the proper divisors of a given number, as well as a function to display a table of proper divisors for a range of numbers. It imports modules for working with prime factors, lists, and comparisons. The main function uses the fTable function to display the proper divisors of numbers from 1 to 10, and then finds the number in the range 1 to 20,000 with the most proper divisors. The code demonstrates how to use functional programming techniques to work with divisors and display the results in a table format.
