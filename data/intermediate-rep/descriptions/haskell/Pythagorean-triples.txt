This code defines a function `pytr` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of tuples representing Pythagorean triples where the sum of the elements is less than or equal to `n`. The function uses list comprehensions and filtering to generate the Pythagorean triples. The `main` function calls `pytr` with the value 100 and then prints the total number of triples and the number of primitive triples (where the greatest common divisor of the elements is 1).
