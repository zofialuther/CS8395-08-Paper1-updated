This code defines a data type `Quaternion` representing a quaternion with real and imaginary parts. It includes functions to create quaternions from a scalar or a list, extract the real and imaginary parts, calculate the norm and conjugate of a quaternion, and perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of these functions by creating and manipulating quaternions and printing the results.
