This code is for a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. It starts by creating an empty FIFO queue and then checks if it is empty, which returns true. Then it pushes values 1, 2, 3, and 4 into the queue and checks if it is empty again, which returns false. It then uses the pop function to retrieve the values from the queue in the order they were added, returning Just 1, Just 2, Just 3, and Just 4 respectively. Finally, it attempts to pop from the now empty queue, which returns Nothing.
