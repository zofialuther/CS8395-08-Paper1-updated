This code implements a range consolidation algorithm that takes a list of pairs of floats and consolidates overlapping or adjacent ranges into a single range. The `consolidated` function uses a fold and sorting to achieve this. The code also includes a set of test cases and a main function to display the results. Additionally, there are display formatting functions such as `tabulated`, `showPairs`, `showPair`, and `showNum` to present the results in a readable format. Overall, this code provides a way to consolidate ranges of floats and display the results in a tabulated format.
