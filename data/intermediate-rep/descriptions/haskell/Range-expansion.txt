This code takes a string representing a range of numbers in a specific format and expands it into a list of individual numbers. The input string includes both individual numbers and ranges separated by commas. The code processes each range and adds the individual numbers within the range to the final list. The output is a list of all the individual numbers from the input range, sorted in ascending order.
