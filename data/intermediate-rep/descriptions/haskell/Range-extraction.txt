This code defines a function called extractRange that takes a list of integers and returns a string. It uses the intercalate function from the Data.List module to join the elements of a list with a specified separator, in this case, a comma. The function f is defined to process the input list and create a list of strings representing consecutive ranges of numbers. It uses pattern matching to check for consecutive numbers and creates the range representation by joining the start and end numbers with a hyphen. The function also includes a helper function g to handle the consecutive number checking. Overall, the code efficiently extracts and represents consecutive ranges of numbers from a list as a string.
