This code defines a function called "unique" that takes a list of elements and returns a new list with only the unique elements. It achieves this by converting the list to a Set, which automatically removes duplicates, and then converting the Set back to a list. The "qualified" keyword is used to avoid name clashes with other modules. The function is polymorphic, meaning it can work with any type of elements as long as they are orderable.
