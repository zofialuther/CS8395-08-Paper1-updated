This code is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". It defines the data type `Choice` with three options: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The `beats` function determines the outcome of the game by comparing two choices. The `genrps` function generates a random choice for the computer. The `getrps` function allows the user to input their choice. The `game` function simulates the game by comparing the user's and computer's choices and keeping track of the score. Finally, the `main` function starts the game with equal initial scores for both the player and the computer.
