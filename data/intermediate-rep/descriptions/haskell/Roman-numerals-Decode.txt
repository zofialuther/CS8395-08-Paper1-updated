This code defines a function `romanValue` that takes a Roman numeral as input and returns its corresponding integer value. It does so by using a list of tuples containing Roman numeral symbols and their corresponding integer values, and then applies a transformation function to convert the Roman numeral into its integer value. The `main` function then demonstrates the `romanValue` function by applying it to a list of Roman numerals and printing their integer values.
