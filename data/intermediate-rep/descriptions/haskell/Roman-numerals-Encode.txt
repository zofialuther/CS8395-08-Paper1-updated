This code defines a function `digit` that takes a character `x`, `y`, `z`, and an integer `k`, and returns a string representing the Roman numeral equivalent of `k` based on the input characters. It also defines a function `toRoman` that takes an integer `x` and recursively converts it into the Roman numeral representation. The `main` function demonstrates the conversion of a list of integers to their Roman numeral equivalents and prints the results.
