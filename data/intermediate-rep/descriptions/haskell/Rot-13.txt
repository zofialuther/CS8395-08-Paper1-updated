This code defines functions for interacting with files and handles in the System.IO module. The hInteract function takes a function, an input handle, and an output handle, and applies the function to the input handle's contents, then writes the result to the output handle. The processByTemp function takes a function and a file name, opens the file, applies the function to its contents, and then closes and renames the file. The process function takes a function and a list of file names, and applies the function to each file in the list. If the list is empty, it applies the function to standard input and standard output. Overall, this code provides a set of functions for processing file contents using handles and temporary files.
