The given code defines a function runLengths that takes a string as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a run-length encoding of consecutive characters in the input string. The main function tests the runLengths function by encoding a test string, displaying the encoded result, and comparing it with the original string to validate the encoding. The showLengths function is used to display the encoded run-lengths in a human-readable format.
