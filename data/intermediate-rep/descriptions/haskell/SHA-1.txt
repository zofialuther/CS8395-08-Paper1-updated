This code defines a module called Digestor that contains functions for converting a string to a SHA1 hash using the Data.Digest.Pure.SHA library. The convertString function takes a string and converts it to a ByteString, while the convertToSHA1 function takes a string and returns its SHA1 hash as a string. The main function demonstrates the usage of the convertToSHA1 function by converting the string "Rosetta Code" to its SHA1 hash and printing the result.
