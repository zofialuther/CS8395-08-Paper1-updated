This code uses the map function to apply a lambda function to each element in the list "needles". The lambda function takes each element "x" and returns a tuple with the element itself and the result of finding the indices of "x" in the list "haystack". The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an element from "needles" and a list of indices where that element is found in "haystack". In this specific case, the result is [("Washington",[]),("Bush",[4,7])].
