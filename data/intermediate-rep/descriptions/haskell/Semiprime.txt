This code defines a function called isSemiprime that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value. It first calculates the prime factors of the input number and then checks if the length of the factors list is either 2 and their product equals the input number, or if the length is 1 and the square of the single factor equals the input number. If either of these conditions is met, the function returns true, indicating that the input number is a semiprime. Otherwise, it returns false.
