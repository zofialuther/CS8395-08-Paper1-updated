This code defines the infinite list of prime numbers, "primesST", using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial list of prime numbers 2 and 3, and then recursively applies the sieve function to generate additional prime numbers. The sieve function filters out non-prime numbers from a list by checking for remainders when dividing by the prime numbers in the list. The code efficiently generates prime numbers by using lazy evaluation and memoization.
