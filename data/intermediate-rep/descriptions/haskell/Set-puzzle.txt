This code defines a game called "Set". It first creates the data structures for the different attributes of a card (color, symbol, count, and shading). It then provides functions to generate a random hand of cards, check if a set of cards is valid, and display the solutions for a given hand. The main function demonstrates the use of the showSolutions function to display hands of 9 and 12 cards with 4 and 6 solutions, respectively.
