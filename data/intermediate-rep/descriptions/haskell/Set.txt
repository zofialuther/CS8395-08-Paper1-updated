This code demonstrates various functions from the Data.List module in Haskell. It starts by creating a list 's3' with duplicate elements removed using the 'nub' function. It then creates another list 's4'. The 'union' function is used to combine the two lists and remove duplicates, while the 'intersect' function returns the common elements between the two lists. The 'difference' between the two lists is obtained using the '\\\\' operator. Additionally, the code shows how to insert an element at the beginning of a list using the ':' operator, and how to remove the first occurrence of an element using the 'delete' function.
