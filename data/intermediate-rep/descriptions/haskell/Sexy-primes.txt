This code defines a data structure called Group and a function to collect and categorize prime numbers into different groups such as pairs, triplets, quadruplets, and quintuplets. The program then calculates and displays the number of each type of group and the last few elements in each group. It also identifies and displays unsexy prime numbers. The code uses TemplateHaskell to automatically generate lenses for the Group data type, making it easier to access and manipulate the data. Additionally, the program limits the prime numbers to those less than 1000035 and displays the results in a human-readable format.
