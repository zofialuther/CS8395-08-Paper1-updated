This code uses the Diagrams library to create a Sierpinski triangle, a fractal shape formed by repeatedly subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller triangles. The `triangle` function creates an equilateral triangle with a black fill and no outline. The `reduce` function stacks three triangles on top of each other, forming a larger triangle. The `sierpinski` function uses `reduce` to iterate and create a series of triangles. Finally, the `main` function uses the `defaultMain` function to display the 7th iteration of the Sierpinski triangle.
