This code is a simple GUI application using the Gtk library in Haskell. It creates a window with a label and a button. When the button is clicked, it updates the label to display the number of times it has been clicked. The application uses an IORef to keep track of the click count. The main function initializes the GUI, sets up the window and its components, and then starts the GUI event loop.
