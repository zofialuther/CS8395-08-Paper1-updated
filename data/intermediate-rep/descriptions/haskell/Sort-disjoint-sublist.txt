This code includes three functions for sorting a list based on a given set of indices. The first function, disSort1, partitions the list based on the given indices, sorts the sublist, and then merges it with the rest of the list. The second function, disSort2, converts the list to an array, extracts the sublist based on the indices, sorts it, and then replaces the elements in the original array. The third function, disSort3, achieves similar results as disSort2 but uses mutable arrays for in-place updating. The main function demonstrates the usage of these sorting functions with a sample list and indices.
