This code includes the implementation of a sorting algorithm called "bogosort" in Haskell. The "bogosort" algorithm sorts a list by repeatedly shuffling the elements randomly until the list is in sorted order. The code also includes a function to check if a list is sorted according to a given comparison function, as well as a function to shuffle a list using IO operations. The "bogosortBy" function takes a comparison function as an argument and uses the "shuffle" function to sort the list. The "bogosort" function is a specialized version of "bogosortBy" that uses the less than operator as the comparison function. Overall, this code provides the implementation of the "bogosort" sorting algorithm in Haskell.
