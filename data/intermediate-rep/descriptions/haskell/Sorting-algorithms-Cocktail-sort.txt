This code implements the cocktail sort algorithm, which is a variation of the bubble sort algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is then repeated in the opposite direction. The function `cocktailSort` takes a list `l` and uses the `swappingPass` function to perform the sorting. The `swappingPass` function compares adjacent elements in the list and swaps them if necessary, and it keeps track of whether any swaps were made. The `cocktailSort` function then continues to swap elements in both directions until the list is sorted, and returns the sorted list.
