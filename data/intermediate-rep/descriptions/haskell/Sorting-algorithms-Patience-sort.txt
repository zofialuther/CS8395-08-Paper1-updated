This code implements the patience sort algorithm, a sorting algorithm that is efficient for small to medium-sized lists. The algorithm works by creating piles of cards (in this case, the elements of the input list) and then merging the piles in a way that efficiently sorts the elements. The code uses mutable arrays and the ST monad to achieve this, and includes typeclass instances for the Pile data type. The main function demonstrates the use of the patienceSort function to sort a list of numbers and print the result.
