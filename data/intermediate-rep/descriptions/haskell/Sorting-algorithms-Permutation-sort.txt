This code defines a function called "permutationSort" that takes a list as input and returns the first permutation of the list that is sorted. It uses the "permute" function to generate all possible permutations of the list and then filters them using the "sorted" function. The "sorted" function checks if a list is sorted in ascending order. The "permute" function uses the "foldM" function from the Control.Monad module to insert each element of the input list into every possible position in the resulting permutations.
