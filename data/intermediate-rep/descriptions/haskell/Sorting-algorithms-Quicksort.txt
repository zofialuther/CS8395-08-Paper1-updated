This code is a quicksort implementation in Haskell. It defines a function qsort that takes a list as input and recursively sorts it in ascending order. The base case is an empty list, which returns an empty list. For non-empty lists, it selects the first element as the pivot (x) and then uses list comprehension to partition the remaining elements into two sublists - one with elements less than the pivot and another with elements greater than or equal to the pivot. It then recursively applies the qsort function to each of these sublists and concatenates the results together with the pivot in the middle to produce the final sorted list.
