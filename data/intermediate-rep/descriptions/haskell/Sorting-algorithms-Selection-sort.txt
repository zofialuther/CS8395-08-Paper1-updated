This code defines a function called "selSort" which takes a list of comparable elements and sorts it in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm. It first checks if the list is empty and returns an empty list if so. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the list and removes it using the "delete" function from the Data.List module. It then recursively calls itself on the modified list and appends the maximum element to the sorted result.
