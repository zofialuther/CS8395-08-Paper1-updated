This code imports the Soundex module from the Text.PhoneticCode library and defines a main function that applies the soundexSimple function to a list of words ("Soundex", "Example", "Sownteks", "Ekzampul") using the <*> operator. The resulting soundex codes for each word are then printed to the console using the mapM_ function. This code demonstrates how to use the Soundex phonetic encoding algorithm to generate a phonetic code for a given set of words.
