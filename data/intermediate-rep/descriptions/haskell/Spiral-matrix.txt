This code generates a spiral pattern of numbers in a 2D array and prints it out in a visually appealing format. The `spiral` function takes the height, width, and starting number as input and generates the spiral pattern by recursively adding smaller spirals rotated 90 degrees. The `main` function then formats and prints the spiral pattern to the console. The code utilizes the `Data.List` module for the `transpose` function and the `Text.Printf` module for formatting the output. The author notes that the code may be improved for readability.
