This code defines a stack data structure using the State monad. It includes functions for pushing and popping elements onto the stack, as well as checking if the stack is empty and peeking at the top element. The `push` function adds an element to the stack, while `pop` removes the top element and returns it. The `empty` function checks if the stack is empty and `peek` returns the top element without removing it. The `nonEmpty` function is a helper function that ensures the stack is not empty before performing certain operations.
