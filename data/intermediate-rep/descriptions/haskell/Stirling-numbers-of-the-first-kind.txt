This code defines a function `stirling1` that calculates the Stirling numbers of the first kind using memoization. It then creates a table of Stirling numbers for various values of `n` and `k`, and prints the table along with the maximum value of S1(100, k) for k ranging from 1 to 100. The table is displayed with formatted rows and columns, providing a clear representation of the Stirling numbers.
