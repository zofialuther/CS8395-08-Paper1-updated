This code implements the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which calculate the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. The `stirling2` function utilizes memoization to efficiently calculate the values. The main function uses printf to display a table of Stirling numbers for different n and k values, and then finds the maximum value of S2(100, k). The table is generated using the `table` list of tuples, with each row representing a different n value and each element in the row representing a different k value. Overall, this code provides a useful tool for calculating and visualizing Stirling numbers.
