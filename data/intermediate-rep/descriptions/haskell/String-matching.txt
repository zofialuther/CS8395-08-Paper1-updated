This code includes functions from the Data.List module in Haskell to check for various types of string relationships. The code demonstrates the use of isPrefixOf, isSuffixOf, and isInfixOf functions to check if one string is a prefix, suffix, or an infix of another string. It also defines a custom function called infixes that uses findIndices and tails to find all occurrences of a specific string as a prefix within another string. The example provided shows the result of using the infixes function to find the indices of occurrences of "ab" as a prefix in the string "abcdefabqqab".
