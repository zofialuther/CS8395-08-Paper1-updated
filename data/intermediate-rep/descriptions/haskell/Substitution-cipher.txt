This code is a simple implementation of a cipher program in Haskell. It defines a custom data type `Command` which can either be a `Cipher`, `Decipher`, or `Invalid`. The program takes command line arguments and uses them to either encrypt or decrypt a given text using a simple substitution cipher. The `runCommand` function processes the command and performs the encryption or decryption using the `convert` function, which replaces characters in the input text according to the given substitution map. The main function parses the command line arguments, runs the command, and prints the result to the console.
