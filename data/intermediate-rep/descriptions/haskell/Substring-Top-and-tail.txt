This code defines three functions (remFirst, remLast, remBoth) that manipulate strings by removing characters from either the beginning, end, or both ends of the string. If the input string is too short for the particular operation, the functions will return an empty string. The main function demonstrates the use of these functions by applying them to the string "Some string" and printing the results to the console.
