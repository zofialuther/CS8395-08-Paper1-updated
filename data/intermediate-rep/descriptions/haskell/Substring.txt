This code includes functions to manipulate text in Haskell. It defines functions to extract substrings from a given text based on specified indices, extract the portion of the text from a specific index to the end, and remove the last character from a text. Additionally, it provides functions to extract substrings based on a specific character or string within the text. The code also includes a test section that demonstrates the use of these functions with a sample text.
