This code defines a function called digsum that takes in two integral numbers, base and n, and calculates the sum of the digits of n when expressed in base base. It uses a recursive helper function f to iterate through the digits of n and accumulate the sum. The main function demonstrates the usage of digsum by calculating the sum of the digits of the number 255 when expressed in base 16, which results in the output "FF" and the sum of 30.
