This code is a collection of functions to calculate the sum of multiples of 3 and 5, as well as their least common multiple (LCM). The `sum35` function calculates the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 up to a given number, while the `sumMulS` function extends this functionality to a variable list of input numbers. The `pairLCM` function calculates the LCM of pairs of numbers, and the `main` function includes some test cases for the `sum35` and `sumMulS` functions. Overall, this code provides efficient calculations for the sum of multiples and their LCM for various input scenarios.
