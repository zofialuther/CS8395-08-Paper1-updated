This code defines a function seriesSum that takes a function f and uses the foldr function to compute the sum of the application of f to each element in a list. It also defines a function inverseSquare that takes the inverse of the square of a number. In the main function, it calculates the seriesSum of the inverseSquare function applied to the numbers 1 to 1000 and prints the result.
