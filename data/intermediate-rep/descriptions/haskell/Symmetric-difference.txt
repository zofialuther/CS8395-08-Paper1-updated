This code demonstrates the use of the set difference operator (\\) in Haskell. It subtracts the elements of set b from set a and then subtracts the elements of set a from set b. The resulting sets only contain the elements that are unique to each set, with "Serena" being unique to set a and "Jim" being unique to set b.
