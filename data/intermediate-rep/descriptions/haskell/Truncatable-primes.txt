This code imports functions to work with prime numbers and lists from specific libraries. It then defines a function to generate all prime numbers below 1,000,000 that do not contain the digit 0. It also defines two functions to check if a number is left or right truncatable prime. Finally, the main function uses these functions to find and print the largest left and right truncatable prime numbers below 1,000,000.
