The given code is a Haskell program that generates a truth table for a logical expression. It takes an expression as input and calculates the truth values for all possible combinations of variables. It uses the Control.Monad and Data.List libraries for mapping, folding, and manipulating lists, as well as the Data.Maybe library for handling Maybe values. The main function of the program reads an input logical expression from the user and prints the corresponding truth table. The code also includes a function for evaluating the token sequence in a given context and a function for pretty printing the truth table.
