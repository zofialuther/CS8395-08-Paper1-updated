This code defines a function to generate the Van Eck sequence, a mathematical sequence where each element is determined based on the previous occurrences of that element in the sequence. The code uses mapAccumL to generate the sequence and a map to keep track of the occurrences of each element. It also includes a test to print a subset of the Van Eck sequence for different input values.
