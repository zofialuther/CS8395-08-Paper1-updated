This code is a collection of functions and data types for working with van der Corput sequences, which are sequences of numbers in a specific base. The code includes functions for converting between base b digits and numbers, as well as for generating the n'th element in a base b van der Corput sequence. There is also a function for printing specified ranges of van der Corput numbers for different bases. The main function demonstrates the usage of these functions by printing van der Corput numbers for small bases as well as for the base 123.
