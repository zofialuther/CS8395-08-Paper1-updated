This code defines a binary tree data structure using the Data.Tree module in Haskell. The binary tree contains integer values and has a structure where each node can have multiple child nodes. The main function of the code prints out a visual representation of the tree using the drawTree function, which converts the tree into a string and displays it in a hierarchical format.
