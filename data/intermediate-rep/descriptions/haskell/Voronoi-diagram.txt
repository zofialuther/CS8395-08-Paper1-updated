This code is a Haskell program that generates a Voronoi diagram and saves it as a BMP image. It uses Repa, a library for high-performance, regular, multi-dimensional parallel arrays. The program first generates random centers for the Voronoi diagram and then calculates the nearest center for each cell in the diagram. It then generates a color table and applies it to the Voronoi diagram to produce the final colored image, which is saved as "out.bmp". The code uses parallel computation to improve performance.
