This code is a simple command-line program written in Haskell that takes a search pattern as a command-line argument and searches for files in the current directory matching that pattern. It uses the System.Environment and System.Directory modules to get the current directory and the command-line arguments, and the System.FilePath.Find module to perform the file search. The program then prints out the list of matching files found in the current directory.
