This code is a simple word frequency counter. It reads the contents from the standard input (stdin), then converts them to lowercase and splits them into individual words. It then counts the frequency of each word and prints the top 'n' most frequent words, where 'n' is specified as a command line argument. The word frequencies are stored using a HashMap, and the counts are sorted in descending order before being printed.
