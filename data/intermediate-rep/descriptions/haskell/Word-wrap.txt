The code defines a string `ss` containing a passage of text. It also includes a function `wordwrap` that takes a maximum line length as input and wraps the text to fit within that length. The `main` function uses `wordwrap` to wrap the text to two different line lengths (72 and 32) and then prints the wrapped text to the console.
