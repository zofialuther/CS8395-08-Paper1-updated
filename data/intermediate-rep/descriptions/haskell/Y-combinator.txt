This code defines a higher-order function 'fix' which uses function recursion in its own definition. It then demonstrates the use of 'fix' to define factorial and Fibonacci functions using recursion. It also includes two different implementations of a lazy infinite list of Fibonacci numbers using the Y-combinator. The 'main' function showcases the use of these functions by applying them to a range of input values and printing the results.
