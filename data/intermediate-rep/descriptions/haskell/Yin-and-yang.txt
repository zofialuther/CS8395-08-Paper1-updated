This code creates a yin-yang diagram using the diagrams library in Haskell. It defines the shape and color of the yin-yang symbol and then uses the Cairo backend to render it. The main function pads and places two yin-yang diagrams next to each other. The code also includes language extensions to remove monomorphism restriction.
