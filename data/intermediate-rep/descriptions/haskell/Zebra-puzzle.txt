This code is a solution to the Einstein's Riddle, a logic puzzle that involves a set of clues and constraints to determine the nationality, color, pet, drink, and cigarette brand of each of the five residents of a particular street. The code generates and checks all possible combinations of the variables (nation, color, pet, drink, and smoke) based on the given constraints and outputs the answer along with the nationality of the person who owns a Zebra. The main function then prints all the valid solutions and indicates when there are no more solutions.
