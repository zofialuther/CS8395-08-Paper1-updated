This code takes a 2D array of integers and formats it neatly by displaying the values in a grid with proper spacing. It uses the `printf` function to format each integer and then arranges them in rows and columns. The `show2d` function uses list comprehension to iterate through the array and format the integers, and then uses the `unlines` and `unwords` functions to arrange them properly. The `main` function applies the `show2d` function to a list of 2D arrays and prints the formatted output to the console.
