This Java program is a simple implementation of the card game "24". The program generates a set of random digits and asks the user to use these digits to create the number 24 using basic arithmetic operations. The program also has the ability to provide a solution if the user gets stuck. The user can input their expression, and the program will validate it, evaluate the expression, and determine if it equals 24. The program uses various algorithms and methods to handle the validation, evaluation, and permutation of digits and operators.
