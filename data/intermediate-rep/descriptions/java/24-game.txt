This Java program, Game24, generates a sequence of four random digits and prompts the user to use them to make the number 24 using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). It then evaluates the user's input and checks if the result matches 24. If the result is correct, it displays "Correct!" otherwise it displays "Not correct." It also verifies if the input contains the same digits as the generated sequence.
