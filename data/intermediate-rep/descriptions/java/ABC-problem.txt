The given code is a Java program that checks if a given word can be formed using a set of letter blocks. The main method initializes a list of letter blocks and then iterates through a list of words, checking if each word can be formed using the letter blocks. The canMakeWord method is a recursive function that checks if a word can be formed by permuting through the available letter blocks. If a word can be formed, the program will print the word along with a message indicating that it can be formed using the given letter blocks.
