This Java program reads a file called "days_of_week.txt" and processes the data to find abbreviations for each day of the week. It checks for the presence of all seven days and then iterates through the days to find the shortest abbreviation that can uniquely represent each day. If an abbreviation cannot be found, it prints " âˆž " and the original line. The final output displays the length of the shortest abbreviation and the corresponding line for each day.
