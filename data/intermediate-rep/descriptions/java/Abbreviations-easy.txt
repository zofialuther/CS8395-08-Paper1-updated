This Java program, AbbreviationsEasy, takes user input and verifies if the input matches any command abbreviations from a predefined list. It uses a HashMap to store the command abbreviations and the number of capital letters in each abbreviation. The program then prompts the user to enter a command to verify, splits the input into individual words, and compares each word to the stored abbreviations. If a match is found, it prints the matched abbreviation in uppercase. If no match is found, it prints an error message. The program also includes a method to count the number of capital letters in a word.
