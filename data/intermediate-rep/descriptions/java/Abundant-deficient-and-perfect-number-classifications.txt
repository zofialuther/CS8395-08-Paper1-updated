This Java program classifies numbers from 1 to 20,000 as deficient, perfect, or abundant based on their proper divisors sum. It calculates the sum of proper divisors for each number and then categorizes them accordingly. The program then prints the count of deficient, perfect, and abundant numbers. It uses LongStream to efficiently calculate the proper divisors sum for each number.
