This Java code defines a class called AccumulatorFactory that contains a method to create an accumulator function. The accumulator function takes a Number as input and returns a new Number that is the accumulated sum of all previous inputs. The code also includes a main method to demonstrate the use of the accumulator function by applying it to different input values and printing the result. The accumulator function handles different types of Number inputs, such as Long, Double, BigInteger, etc., and converts them to the appropriate type for accumulation.
