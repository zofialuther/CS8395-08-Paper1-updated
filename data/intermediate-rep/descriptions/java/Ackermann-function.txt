This code includes two classes, IterativeAckermannMemoryOptimization and IterativeAckermann, which are used to calculate the Ackermann function iteratively with memory optimization. The IterativeAckermannMemoryOptimization class extends the Thread class and is responsible for managing the memory usage during the calculation process. It sets a limit on the percentage of free memory that can be used and adjusts it based on the operating system. It also starts the calculation process and notifies when the memory consumption is below the limit. The IterativeAckermann class represents the actual iterative Ackermann function calculation. It includes methods to set and get the values of m and n, as well as the hash size and consumed heap. The main method initiates the memory-optimized iterative Ackermann calculation process. Overall, this code provides a memory-efficient way to calculate the Ackermann function iteratively.
