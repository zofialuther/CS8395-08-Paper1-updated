This Java program calculates and prints out all pairs of amicable numbers within a specified limit. It uses parallel streams to efficiently generate a map of numbers and their respective sum of proper divisors. Then, it iterates through the map to find and print pairs of numbers where the sum of proper divisors of one number equals the other and vice versa. The properDivsSum method is used to calculate the sum of proper divisors for a given number.
