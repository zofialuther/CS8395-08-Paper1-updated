This code creates a Pendulum class that extends JPanel and implements the Runnable interface. The Pendulum is drawn as a simple pendulum with a ball swinging back and forth. The angle and length of the pendulum are set, and the paint method is used to draw the pendulum. The run method is used to update the position of the pendulum based on its angle, velocity, and acceleration, and the repaint method is called to update the display. The main method creates a JFrame and adds the Pendulum to it, then starts a new thread to run the pendulum animation.
