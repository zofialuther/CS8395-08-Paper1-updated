This Java code defines a functional interface SelfApplicable and a class Utils with a method to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. The SelfApplicable interface has a single method apply that takes a SelfApplicable input and returns an output. The Utils class has a static method y that returns a function for calculating a recursive function, a method fix that uses the y method to create a fixed-point combinator, and a method fib that uses the fixed-point combinator to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. The code uses functional programming concepts and higher-order functions to achieve the recursive calculation of the Fibonacci sequence.
