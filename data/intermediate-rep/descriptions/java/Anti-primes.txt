This Java program calculates and prints the first 20 anti-prime numbers. An anti-prime number, also known as highly composite number, is a positive integer with more divisors than any smaller positive integer. The program includes a method to count the number of divisors for a given integer, and then iterates through numbers to find the first 20 anti-prime numbers and their respective number of divisors.
