This code creates a class called ArrayCallback and a main method that initializes an array of integers and calculates the sum of the cubes of each element in the array using the Java Streams API. The code uses the map function to cube each element, prints the result, and then reduces the stream to calculate the sum of the cubes. Finally, it prints the sum of the cubes.
