This Java program takes two integer inputs from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations on them. It calculates the sum, difference, product, division (truncates towards 0), and remainder of the two numbers. The results are then displayed with explanatory labels using the print statements. The code also includes a note cautioning against using integer addition in print statements due to potential confusion with string concatenation.
