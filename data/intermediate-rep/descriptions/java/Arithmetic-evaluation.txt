This Java code defines a class called ArithmeticEvaluation that implements a simple arithmetic expression evaluator. It includes a variety of functionalities such as parsing mathematical expressions into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and evaluating the result. The code also includes classes for handling numbers, binary expressions, and different types of binary operators. The main method demonstrates the use of the code by parsing and evaluating several test expressions.
