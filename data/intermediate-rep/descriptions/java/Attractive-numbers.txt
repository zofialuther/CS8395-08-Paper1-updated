This Java code defines a class called "Attractive" with two static methods. The first method, "is_prime", checks if a given number is a prime number. The second method, "count_prime_factors", counts the number of prime factors for a given number. The main method uses these two methods to find and print all attractive numbers (numbers with prime count of prime factors) up to a specified maximum value.
