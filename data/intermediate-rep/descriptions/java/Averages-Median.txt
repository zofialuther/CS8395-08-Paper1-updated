This code calculates the median of a list of double values. It first creates a copy of the input list to prevent modification. It then sorts the copied list and calculates the median value. If the list has an even number of elements, it returns the average of the two middle values, and if the list has an odd number of elements, it returns the middle value. If the list is empty, it returns 0.
