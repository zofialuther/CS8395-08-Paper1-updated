The code defines a class called RootMeanSquare with a method to calculate the root mean square of a set of numbers. The rootMeanSquare method takes in a variable number of double values, squares each value, sums the squares, divides by the number of values, and then returns the square root of the result. The main method creates an array of numbers from 1 to 10, calls the rootMeanSquare method with the array as an argument, and prints the result. This code effectively calculates the root mean square of a set of numbers and demonstrates its use with a specific set of values.
