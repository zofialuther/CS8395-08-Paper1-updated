This Java program called "BestShuffle" contains methods to shuffle words in a way that maximizes the difference from the original word. The main method initializes an array of words and then calls the "bestShuffle" method for each word, printing the result. The "bestShuffle" method shuffles the characters of the input word and then swaps any pair of characters to maximize the number of differences from the original word. The "shuffle" method is used to randomly shuffle the characters of a word. The "count" method is used to count the number of characters in the shuffled word that match the original word.
