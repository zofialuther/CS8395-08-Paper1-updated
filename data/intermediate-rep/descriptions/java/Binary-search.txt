This Java code implements an iterative binary search algorithm to find the index of a specific element in a sorted array. The binarySearch method takes an array of integers and the value to be found as input, and returns the index of the value if it exists in the array, otherwise it returns -1. The main method demonstrates the usage of the binarySearch method by creating an array of integers, defining a value to search for, and then printing the result of the binary search to the console.
