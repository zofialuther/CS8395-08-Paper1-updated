This Java code creates a simple GUI application to display a Bresenham line drawing algorithm. The main class sets up a JFrame and adds a custom JPanel for drawing the lines. The BresenhamPanel class extends JPanel and overrides the paintComponent method to draw eight lines in different directions using the Bresenham line drawing algorithm. The drawLine method implements the Bresenham algorithm for drawing lines with integer coordinates. The plot method is used to draw individual pixels on the panel. When the program is run, it displays the lines in a window with the specified dimensions.
