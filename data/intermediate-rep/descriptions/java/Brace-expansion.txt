This Java code defines a class called BraceExpansion with a main method that demonstrates the functionality of the expand method. The expand method takes a string as input and recursively expands any brace-enclosed lists within the string. The expandR method is a helper method that performs the actual expansion by iterating through the string and replacing brace-enclosed lists with their individual elements. The code demonstrates how the expand method can be used to expand various example strings containing brace-enclosed lists.
