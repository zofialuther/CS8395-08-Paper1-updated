This Java program, "BrilliantNumbers", generates and displays the first 100 brilliant numbers. It first calculates prime numbers up to a limit and then uses these prime numbers to find brilliant numbers, which are the product of two prime numbers. The program then sorts and prints the brilliant numbers. Additionally, it also calculates and displays the first brilliant number greater than or equal to 10 raised to various powers. The program uses a PrimeGenerator class to efficiently calculate the prime numbers and organizes them by digits for the subsequent calculations.
