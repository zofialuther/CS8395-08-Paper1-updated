The GameNumber class is a subclass of AbstractGuessNumber and is designed for a game that involves guessing a 4-digit number. It includes methods for checking if a given array of digits is a valid guess, parsing a number into an array of digits, and generating a random 4-digit number for the game. The defineNumber method initializes the game's number by calling generateRandom and setting the digits array. The toString method returns the digits array as a string.
