This Java program is a simple implementation of the Bulls and Cows game. The game generates a random 4-digit number with no duplicate digits, and the player has to guess the number within a certain number of attempts. The program uses a combination of bulls and cows to provide feedback to the player after each guess. If the player correctly guesses the number, the program will display the number of guesses it took to win the game. The code also includes a method to check for duplicate digits in a number.
