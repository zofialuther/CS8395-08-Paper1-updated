This code is a Java program that reads data from a CSV file containing employee information, processes the data, and writes the processed information to a new CSV file. 

First, it configures the CSV reader with the necessary settings, including setting the line separator and attaching a bean list processor to handle the data. Then, it creates a CSV parser with the configured settings and parses the rows from the CSV file into a list of employee beans. 

After parsing, the code performs additional operations such as storing the data, deleting duplicates, and rearranging words in a specific order. 

Finally, it sets up a CSV writer with the necessary settings, including a bean writer processor for handling annotated fields in the Employee class, and writes the processed employee data to a new CSV file.
