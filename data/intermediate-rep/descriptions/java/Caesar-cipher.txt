The given code is a Java program that implements a simple Caesar cipher algorithm to encode and decode a given string. The main method initializes a string and then calls the encode and decode methods with a specified offset value. The encode method takes a string and an offset as input and shifts each letter in the string by the given offset, wrapping around if necessary. The decode method reverses the encoding process by shifting the letters in the opposite direction. The program demonstrates the functionality of the cipher by encoding and then decoding the given string with a specified offset.
