The provided code implements the Calkin-Wilf sequence, a sequence of rational numbers derived from a binary tree structure. The main method prints the first 20 terms of the sequence and calculates the index of a specific rational number in the sequence. The code also includes various methods for performing arithmetic operations on rational numbers, as well as methods for finding the continued fraction representation and floor value of a rational number. The Rational class represents a rational number and provides methods for basic arithmetic operations.
