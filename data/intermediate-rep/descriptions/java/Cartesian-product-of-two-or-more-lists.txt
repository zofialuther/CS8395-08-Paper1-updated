This code defines a class called CartesianProduct that is capable of generating the Cartesian product of a list of lists. The product method takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of lists representing the Cartesian product. The class also includes a private method called product that is used to recursively generate the Cartesian product. The main method demonstrates the usage of the CartesianProduct class by creating lists of integers and using the class to calculate and print the Cartesian product.
