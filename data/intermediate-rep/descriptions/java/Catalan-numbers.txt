This Java code calculates the Catalan numbers using three different formulas. The first formula is based on a factorial calculation, the second formula uses a recursive approach, and the third formula is based on a mathematical expression. The main method iterates through the first 15 Catalan numbers and prints the results for each formula. The code demonstrates different ways to calculate the Catalan numbers and uses caching to improve performance.
