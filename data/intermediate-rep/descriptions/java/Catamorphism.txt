This Java code demonstrates the use of the Stream API to perform operations on a stream of integers. The main method contains two examples: the first calculates the sum of the integers using the mapToInt and sum methods, while the second example uses the reduce method to calculate the product of the integers. This code showcases the versatility and simplicity of the Stream API for performing common operations on collections of data.
