This code implements the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which is a mathematical theorem that finds a solution to a system of simultaneous congruences. The chineseRemainder method takes two arrays of integers as input, representing the moduli (n) and remainders (a) of the congruences. It then calculates the product of all the moduli and uses it to compute the final solution. The code also includes a helper method, mulInv, which calculates the multiplicative inverse of a number with respect to a modulus. The main method demonstrates the usage of the chineseRemainder method with sample input arrays.
