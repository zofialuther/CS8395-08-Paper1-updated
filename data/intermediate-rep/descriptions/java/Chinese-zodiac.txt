This Java code defines a class called Zodiac, which includes arrays for the Chinese zodiac animals, elements, and their respective characters. It also includes a method to determine whether a given year is "yang" or "yin" based on its parity. The main method uses this information to determine the zodiac sign for a series of years and prints out the corresponding information for each year.
