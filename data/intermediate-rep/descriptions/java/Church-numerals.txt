The given code implements the Church encoding for representing natural numbers using functional programming in Java. The ChurchNum interface is defined as a function that takes another ChurchNum as input and returns a ChurchNum as output. The code provides methods for creating ChurchNum instances for zero, incrementing a number, adding, multiplying, and exponentiating numbers. Additionally, it includes methods for converting an integer to a ChurchNum and vice versa. The main method demonstrates the usage of the implemented functionality by performing arithmetic operations and conversions using ChurchNum instances.
