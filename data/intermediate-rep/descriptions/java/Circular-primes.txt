This Java program identifies and prints the first 19 circular primes, followed by the next 4 circular primes. It also tests the primality of repunits (numbers consisting of only ones) with a certain number of digits. The code utilizes methods to check for prime numbers, cycle through digits, identify circular primes, and test repunits for primality. The program demonstrates the use of BigInteger and arrays in Java.
