This code defines an interface called ValueCapture with a main method that demonstrates the use of Java 8's functional programming features. It creates a list of IntSupplier closures using IntStream and the mapToObj method, where each closure calculates the square of a given integer. The code then retrieves and executes a specific closure from the list, printing the result to the console.
