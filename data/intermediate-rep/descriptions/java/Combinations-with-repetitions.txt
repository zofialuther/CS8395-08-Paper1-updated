The MultiCombinations class is designed to generate combinations of a given set of objects with a specified length. It uses the Combinations class from the ObjectWave utility package to generate the combinations. The class keeps track of the combinations using a HashSet and provides methods to check for more elements and retrieve the next combination. Additionally, it includes a static method for calculating the number of combinations given a set size and length.
