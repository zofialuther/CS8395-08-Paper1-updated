The Quibbler class contains a method called quibble, which takes an array of strings as input and returns a formatted string containing the elements of the array. The method iterates through the array and adds each element to the formatted string, separating them with commas and adding "and" before the last element. The main method demonstrates the functionality of the quibble method by passing different arrays of strings to it and printing the results.
