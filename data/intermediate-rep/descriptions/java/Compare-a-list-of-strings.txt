This code defines a method called 'allEqual' that takes in an array of strings as input. It then checks if all the strings in the array are equal to each other. It does this by comparing each string in the array to the first string in the array. If any string is found to be not equal to the first string, the method returns false. If all the strings are equal, the method returns true.
