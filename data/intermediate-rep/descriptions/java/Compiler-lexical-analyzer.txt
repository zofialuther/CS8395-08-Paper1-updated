This Java code is a lexer that tokenizes input source code. It includes methods for handling different types of tokens such as identifiers, keywords, integers, strings, and operators. The main method reads a file and uses the lexer to tokenize the contents, and then prints out the resulting tokens. The lexer also includes error handling for scenarios such as unrecognized characters, empty character constants, multi-character constants, and invalid numbers.
