This Java code defines a class called Threads, which includes a nested class called DelayedMessagePrinter. This class implements the Runnable interface and is used to create threads that will print a message after a specified delay. The main method creates a CyclicBarrier with a count of 3 and starts three threads, each with a DelayedMessagePrinter instance and a different message to print. The CyclicBarrier is used to ensure that all three threads reach a certain point before proceeding to execute their print statements.
