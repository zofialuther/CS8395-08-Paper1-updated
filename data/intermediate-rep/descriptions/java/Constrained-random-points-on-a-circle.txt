This code generates a fuzzy circle by randomly placing 'X' characters within a 31x31 grid, simulating points within a circle. The program uses the Math.hypot() function to calculate the distance of each point from the center of the grid. Points falling within a certain distance range are considered to be within the circle. The final grid with the fuzzy circle is then printed to the console.
