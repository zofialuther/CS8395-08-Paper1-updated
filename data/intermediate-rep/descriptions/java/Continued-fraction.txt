This Java program defines a class called Test with a method calc that takes a function and an integer as input and performs a series of calculations using the function and the integer. The main method creates a list of functions and then iterates through each function in the list, passing it to the calc method and printing the result. The functions in the list generate different sets of integers based on the input value.
