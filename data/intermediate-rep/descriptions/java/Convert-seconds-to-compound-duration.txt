This code takes an input of seconds and converts it into a more human-readable format of weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It uses the StringBuilder class to build the output string. The code first checks if the input is equal to or greater than a week, then a day, an hour, a minute, and finally, a second. It appends the corresponding value and unit to the string and returns the formatted duration.
