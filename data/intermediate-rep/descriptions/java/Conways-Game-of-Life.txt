This Java code represents the classic Game of Life simulation, where a grid of cells evolves based on simple rules. The program initializes a grid with a specified size and allows the user to set the initial configuration of the grid. The user can also input a custom configuration from a file. Once the initial configuration is set, the program will continuously update and display the grid according to the rules of the Game of Life. The rules determine whether each cell lives, dies, or reproduces based on the number of neighboring cells. The program allows the user to start and stop the simulation, as well as control the speed of the updates. The grid is displayed in the console, and the program continues running until the user decides to stop the simulation.
