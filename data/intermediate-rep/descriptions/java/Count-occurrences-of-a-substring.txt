This Java program contains a method to count the number of occurrences of a substring within a given string. The countSubstring method takes two string parameters, subStr and str, and uses a loop to iterate through the str string, using the indexOf method to find occurrences of the subStr within it. The count of occurrences is incremented for each match found, and the final count is returned. The main method demonstrates the functionality of the countSubstring method by calling it with different input strings and printing the results.
