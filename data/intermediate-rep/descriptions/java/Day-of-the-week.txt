This Java program, called "Yuletide", calculates and prints the years from 2008 to 2121 where Christmas falls on a Sunday. It uses the Calendar and GregorianCalendar classes to loop through each year, check if December 25th is a Sunday, and then prints the years that meet this condition. The program uses the static import of the Calendar class to access its constants and methods more easily.
