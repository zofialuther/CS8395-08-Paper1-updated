This Java code defines a class called DetermineUniqueCharacters that contains a main method. The main method creates a list of words and then iterates through each word to determine if it contains any repeated characters. It uses a HashSet to keep track of the characters seen so far, and then checks each character in the word to see if it has been seen before. If a repeated character is found, it prints out the word, the repeated character, its hexadecimal value, and the positions at which it occurs. If no repeated characters are found, it simply prints that the word has all unique characters.
