This code defines a method that checks whether a given string input consists of only numeric characters. It utilizes the NumberFormat class to attempt to parse the input string as a number, and then compares the length of the input string with the index position of the parse operation to determine if the entire string was successfully parsed as a number. The method returns true if the input is numeric and false if it contains non-numeric characters.
