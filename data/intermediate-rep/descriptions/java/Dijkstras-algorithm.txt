This code implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. It defines a Graph class with methods for building the graph from a set of edges, running Dijkstra's algorithm using a specified source vertex, and printing the shortest path from the source to a specified vertex. The main method initializes a graph with a set of edges, runs Dijkstra's algorithm, and prints the shortest path from a specified start vertex to an end vertex. The code provides a flexible and efficient way to work with graphs and find the shortest paths within them.
