This Java code simulates the dining philosopher problem using multithreading and atomic variables. It includes classes for Fork and Philosopher, with the main class creating and running the simulation. The philosophers take turns eating and pondering while sharing forks, and the program outputs their states and the number of times they have eaten. The simulation runs for a specified number of seconds before ending and displaying the philosopher statistics.
