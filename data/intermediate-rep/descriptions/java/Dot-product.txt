This Java program calculates the dot product of two arrays of double values. The main method initializes two arrays, 'a' and 'b', with specific values and then calls the dotProd method to calculate the dot product of the two arrays. The dotProd method checks if the dimensions of the arrays are equal and then computes the dot product by multiplying corresponding elements of the arrays and summing the results. The result is then printed to the console.
