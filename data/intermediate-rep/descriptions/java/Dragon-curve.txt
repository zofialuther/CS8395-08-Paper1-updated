This code defines a class called DragonCurve that extends the JFrame class to create a window for displaying a fractal known as the Dragon Curve. The DragonCurve class initializes the window and sets up the parameters for drawing the curve. It also includes a method to generate the sequence of turns needed to create the curve, as well as a method to paint the curve on the window using the Graphics class. The main method creates an instance of DragonCurve and makes the window visible, displaying the Dragon Curve fractal.
