This code creates a program that generates a 3D cuboid and allows the user to interact with it. The cuboid is initially displayed and can be scaled and rotated using mouse input. The user can click and drag the mouse to rotate the cuboid and change its orientation. The program uses Java's Swing library to create a graphical user interface for displaying the cuboid and handling user input. The cuboid is drawn using a combination of lines and ovals to represent the edges and vertices. The program sets up a window to display the cuboid and handles the user input for interaction.
