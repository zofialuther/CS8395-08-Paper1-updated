This Java program simulates the Dutch National Flag problem, which involves sorting an array of three distinct values (represented by the enum DutchColors) in a specific order. The program initializes an array of 12 elements with random values from the DutchColors enum, then sorts the array using the Arrays.sort() method. Finally, it checks if the array is correctly sorted and prints the result. This code demonstrates a solution to the Dutch National Flag problem using Java.
