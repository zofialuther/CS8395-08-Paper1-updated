This Java code represents a simulation of a Wolfram Cellular Automaton (CA). The program uses Swing and AWT to create a graphical interface for displaying the CA. The rules for the CA are defined in the `ruleSet` array, and the `rules` method is used to determine the next generation of cells based on the current state. The `drawCa` method draws the cells on the panel, and the `drawLegend` method displays the current rule number. The main method sets up the JFrame and initializes the WolframCA panel for display. The program automatically updates the CA display every 5 seconds with a new rule, creating a dynamic and interactive visualization of the Wolfram CA.
