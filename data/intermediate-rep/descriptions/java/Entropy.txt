This Java code calculates the Shannon entropy of a given string. It first counts the occurrences of each character in the string and then uses the Shannon entropy formula to calculate the entropy. The main method demonstrates the usage of the getShannonEntropy method with various input strings and prints the results. The code uses a hashmap to store the character occurrences and a custom log2 function to calculate the logarithm base 2.
