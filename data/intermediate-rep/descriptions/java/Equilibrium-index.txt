This Java code defines a class called Equlibrium with a main method that initializes an array of integers and calls a method to find the equilibrium indices within the array. The equlibrium_indices method calculates the total sum of the array and then iterates through the array to compare the running sum to the remaining sum in order to identify and print the equilibrium indices where the sum of elements on both sides of the index are equal.
