This Java code defines a class called Mult with a main method that takes two integer inputs from the user. It then performs a series of mathematical operations on the input numbers based on their parity and stores the results in a HashMap. The program ultimately calculates and prints the sum of the final values. The code also includes three additional methods for doubling and halving integers, as well as checking if a number is even.
