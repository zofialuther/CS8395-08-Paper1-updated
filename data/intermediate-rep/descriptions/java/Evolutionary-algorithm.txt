This Java code implements an evolutionary algorithm to generate a string that matches a specific target phrase. The algorithm starts with a random string and then repeatedly mutates it in an attempt to match the target phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL". The fitness of each mutated string is evaluated based on how many characters match the target. The algorithm keeps track of the best mutated string and continues to mutate it until it eventually matches the target phrase. The progress and fitness of the best string are printed out every 100 iterations. The algorithm uses a mutation rate that decreases as the fitness of the best string improves.
