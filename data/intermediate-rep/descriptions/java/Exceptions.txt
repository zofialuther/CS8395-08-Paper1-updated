This code defines a method "foo" that throws an UnsupportedDataTypeException. Within the method, it calls three other methods that may throw exceptions extending IOException. It uses a try-catch block to handle NumberFormatException and FileNotFoundException separately, and then catches any other IOExceptions. If an IOException is caught, it is re-thrown, while the UnsupportedDataTypeException is also handled within the catch block. This approach helps to avoid code duplication while handling different types of exceptions.
