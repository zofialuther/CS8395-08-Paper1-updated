This Java code is a simple program that uses the Runtime class to execute a command in the command prompt and then reads and outputs the result. The main method calls the executeCmd method with the command "ls -oa" as a parameter. The executeCmd method uses Runtime.getRuntime().exec() to execute the command, waits for the process to finish, and then reads the output of the command using an InputStream. It then processes the output and writes it to the console. The code also handles potential exceptions that may occur during the process.
