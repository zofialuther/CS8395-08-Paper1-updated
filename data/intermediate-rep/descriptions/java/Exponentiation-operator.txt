This Java program defines a class Exp with a main method that tests the pow method by calling it with different input values. The pow method calculates the power of a given base to a given exponent, handling negative exponents by recursively calling itself with a positive exponent. The method uses a for loop to iterate through the exponent and multiply the base to the ans variable, which is then returned as the result.
