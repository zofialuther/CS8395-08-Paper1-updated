This Java program calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using an iterative approach. It includes error handling to ensure that the input is valid and provides the correct factorial value as output. The user is prompted to enter a number, and the program will continue to prompt for input until a valid non-negative integer is provided. Once a valid input is received, the program will calculate and display the factorial of the input number.
