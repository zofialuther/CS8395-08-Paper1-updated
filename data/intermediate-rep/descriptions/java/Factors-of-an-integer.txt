This code defines a method that calculates and returns the factors of a given long integer. It uses a TreeSet to store the factors in ascending order and starts by adding the number itself and 1 to the set. Then, it iterates through all numbers less than the square root of the given number to check for any factors. If a factor is found, it is added to the TreeSet along with its corresponding factor. Finally, the method returns the TreeSet containing all the factors.
