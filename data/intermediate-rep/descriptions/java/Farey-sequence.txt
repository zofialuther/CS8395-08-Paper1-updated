This Java code defines a class called Farey that generates the Farey sequence, a set of all fractions between 0 and 1 with a given denominator. The code uses a nested class called Frac to represent fractions and implements a compareTo method to compare fractions based on their values. The genFarey method creates a TreeSet of fractions for a given denominator, and the main method generates and prints the Farey sequence for denominators 1 to 11, as well as the number of fractions in the sequence for denominators 100 to 1000.
