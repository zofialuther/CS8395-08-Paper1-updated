This code implements the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in Java. It includes a method for bit reversal, which is a common operation in the FFT algorithm, and a method for performing the FFT on an array of complex numbers. The main method demonstrates the usage of the FFT by applying it to a simple input array and printing the results. Additionally, it includes a Complex class to represent complex numbers and perform arithmetic operations on them.
