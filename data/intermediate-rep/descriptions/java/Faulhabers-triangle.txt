The code defines a class called FaulhabersTriangle that includes methods for calculating fractions, Bernoulli numbers, binomials, and coefficients for Faulhaber's Triangle. The main method uses these methods to generate and print the coefficients for the first 10 rows of Faulhaber's Triangle, and then uses the coefficients to calculate the sum of the first 1000 terms in the k+1th row of the triangle. The code heavily uses mathematical calculations and operations with fractions and BigDecimal.
