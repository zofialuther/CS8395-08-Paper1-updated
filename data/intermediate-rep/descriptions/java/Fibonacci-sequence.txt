This code defines a utility class called "FibUtil" that provides methods for generating a stream of Fibonacci numbers and calculating the nth Fibonacci number. The "fibStream" method returns a stream of Fibonacci numbers using the LongStream class and a custom LongUnaryOperator implementation to generate each subsequent number in the sequence. The "fib" method uses the "fibStream" method to calculate the nth Fibonacci number by limiting the stream to n elements and reducing it to obtain the final result.
