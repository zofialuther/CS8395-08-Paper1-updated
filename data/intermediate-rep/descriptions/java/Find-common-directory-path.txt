This code defines a method to find the common path among a set of input paths. It takes a variable number of path strings as input and splits each path into an array of folders. It then compares the folders at each index of the arrays to find the common path. If a folder at a particular index is not common among all input paths, the method returns the current common path. If all folders at a particular index are common, the folder is added to the common path string. Finally, the method returns the common path found among all input paths.
