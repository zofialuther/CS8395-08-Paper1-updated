This Java code defines a class called LinePlaneIntersection, which contains a nested class Vector3D for representing 3D vectors. The main method demonstrates the use of the intersectPoint function to calculate the point of intersection between a ray and a plane in 3D space. The code utilizes vector operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and dot product to perform the intersection calculation. The resulting intersection point is then printed to the console.
