This Java code defines a class called FirstClass, which contains a nested interface called Function for defining functions. The main method creates two ArrayLists of Function objects, one containing trigonometric and mathematical functions, and the other containing their inverses. It then demonstrates the composition of these functions by applying them to a specific value and printing the results. Additionally, it includes hard-coded compositions to compare the results. This code showcases the concept of function composition and demonstrates its application in a programming context.
