This Java program, FiveFSS, calculates the number of months with five weekends from the years 1900 through 2100. It utilizes the Calendar and GregorianCalendar classes to iterate through each year and check for months with 31 days that start on a Friday. The program keeps track of the years with no five-weekend months and prints out the total number of such months as well as the specific months and years in which they occur.
