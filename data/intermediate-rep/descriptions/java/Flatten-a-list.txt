This Java code is a program that demonstrates the flattening of a nested list using a custom FlattenUtil class. The main method initializes a nested list called treeList and then calls the flatten method of the FlattenUtil class to flatten the list. The flattened list is then printed to the console. The code also includes a helper method called "a" that creates a list from the given input.
