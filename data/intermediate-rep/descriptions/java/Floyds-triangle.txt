This code defines a class called Floyd with a main method that calls a method to print a triangle with a specified number of rows. The printTriangle method takes an integer parameter and prints a triangle of numbers, with each row containing an increasing sequence of numbers. The number of columns for each row is determined by the formula Math.ceil(Math.log10(n*(n-1)/2 + numsPrinted + 2)), where n is the number of rows. The code then prints the triangle with the specified number of rows, and then prints another triangle with a different number of rows.
