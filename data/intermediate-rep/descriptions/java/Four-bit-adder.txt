The code defines a class called GateLogic, which contains interfaces for one-input gate, two-input gate, and multi-input gate. It also implements various logic gates such as NOT, AND, OR, XOR, HALF_ADDER, FULL_ADDER, and a method to build an adder based on the number of bits. The main method takes input from the command line, creates a multi-bit adder, converts input numbers into arrays of bits, evaluates the outputs using the adder, and displays the result. The code effectively demonstrates the implementation and usage of logic gates and multi-bit adders.
