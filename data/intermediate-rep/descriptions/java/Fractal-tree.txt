This Java code creates a graphical representation of a fractal tree using the Swing framework. The FractalTree class extends JFrame and sets up the window with a specific size and title. The drawTree method uses recursion to draw the tree branches at different angles and depths. The paint method sets the color and initiates the drawing of the tree. When the main method is called, it creates an instance of FractalTree and makes the window visible.
