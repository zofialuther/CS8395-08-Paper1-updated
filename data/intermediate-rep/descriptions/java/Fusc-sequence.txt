This Java program generates and displays the first 61 fusc numbers in a horizontal format, starting at zero. It then identifies and displays the fusc number and its index whose length is greater than any previous fusc number length. The fusc sequence is calculated using a static block that initializes an array with a maximum size of 30,000,000 and fills it with fusc numbers using a recursive formula.
