This code defines an interface called FunctionalKeyListener which extends the KeyListener interface from the java.awt.event package. It provides default implementations for the keyPressed, keyTyped, and keyReleased methods. Additionally, it defines three functional interfaces: Pressed, Typed, and Released, each of which extends the FunctionalKeyListener interface and provides a single abstract method for handling a specific type of key event. This code allows for the creation of custom key event handlers using functional interfaces.
