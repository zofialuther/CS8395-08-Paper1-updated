The GaltonBox class simulates the dropping of balls through a Galton board, a vertical board with pegs, where the balls bounce off the pegs and collect in bins at the bottom. The code creates a GaltonBox object with a specified number of pin rows and ball count, and then runs the simulation. The balls are dropped one at a time and their positions are displayed in the console as they move down the board. The simulation continues until all the balls have reached the bottom and collected in the bins. The code also includes methods for printing the current positions of the balls, the pegs, and the collectors at the bottom.
