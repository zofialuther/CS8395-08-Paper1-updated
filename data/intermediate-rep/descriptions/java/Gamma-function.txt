The GammaFunction class contains two methods for calculating the gamma function: st_gamma and la_gamma. The st_gamma method uses the Stirling approximation formula to calculate the gamma function, while the la_gamma method uses the Lanczos approximation formula. The main method creates an instance of the GammaFunction class and then iterates through a range of values to compare the results of the two approximation methods. The output displays the input value, the result from the Stirling method, and the result from the Lanczos method. This code provides a convenient way to compare the accuracy of the two approximation methods for calculating the gamma function.
