This Java program implements the classic FizzBuzz game using object-oriented programming. It creates an array of Sound objects, each with a trigger number and a corresponding onomatopoeia. The main method then iterates through the numbers 1 to 20, generating the appropriate onomatopoeia based on the triggers and printing the result. The Sound class contains a method to generate the onomatopoeia based on a given number and trigger. This code demonstrates the use of classes, objects, and methods to solve a simple programming problem.
