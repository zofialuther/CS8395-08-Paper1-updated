The code defines a class called GrayCode that contains methods for encoding and decoding Gray code. The grayEncode and grayDecode methods can handle long integer values, while the grayEncode and grayDecode methods can handle BigInteger values. Additionally, the class includes alternative, less efficient versions of grayEncode and grayDecode, which demonstrate the principles of gray encoding and decoding. The main method demonstrates the functionality of the class by printing the binary and Gray code representations of numbers, along with their decoded values. The code also includes a test for encoding and decoding BigInteger values using Gray code.
