This code defines a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two long integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function first checks if either of the input numbers is zero, in which case it simply returns the other number. If both numbers are non-zero, it recursively calculates the GCD by taking the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number. This process continues until one of the numbers becomes zero, at which point the other number is returned as the GCD.
