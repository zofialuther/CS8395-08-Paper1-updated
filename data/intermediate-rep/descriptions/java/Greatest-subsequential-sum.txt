This code defines a function that takes an array of integers as input and calculates the largest sum of a contiguous subarray within the array. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the running sum and the maximum sum encountered so far. If the running sum becomes negative, it resets to 0, as negative numbers would only decrease the sum. Finally, it returns the maximum sum found.
