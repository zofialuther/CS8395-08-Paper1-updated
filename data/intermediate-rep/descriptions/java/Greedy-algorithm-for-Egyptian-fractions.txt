This Java program is designed to calculate the Egyptian fraction representation of rational numbers. It includes a class called "Frac" that represents fractions and contains methods for addition, subtraction, comparison, conversion to BigDecimal, and conversion to Egyptian fractions. The main function of the program demonstrates the use of the "Frac" class by converting specific fractions to their Egyptian fraction representations and analyzing the properties of fractions with varying denominators. The program utilizes mathematical concepts such as greatest common divisors and division to perform the necessary calculations.
