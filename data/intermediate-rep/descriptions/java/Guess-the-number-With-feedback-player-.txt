This Java code is a guessing game where the user thinks of an integer number between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive) and the program will attempt to guess it. The user responds with 'L' if the guess is too low, 'H' if it's too high, or 'C' if it's correct. The program uses the binary search algorithm to make educated guesses based on the user's responses until it determines the correct number.
