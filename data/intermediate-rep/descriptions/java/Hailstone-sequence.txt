This Java code defines a class called Hailstone that includes a method to generate the Hailstone sequence for a given starting number. The code also includes a main method that calculates the longest Hailstone sequence for numbers up to 100,000 using three different methods - a simple way, a more memory-efficient way, and an efficient way for analyzing all sequences. The code utilizes lists, maps, and loops to perform these calculations and prints out the number with the longest sequence and the length of that sequence for each method.
