This Java code defines a class called Happy, which contains a method to check if a given number is a "happy" number. A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 or loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. The main method in the class demonstrates the functionality by printing the first 8 happy numbers.
