This Java code implements a hash join algorithm to merge two tables based on a specified index. The main method initializes two tables with data and then calls the hashJoin method to perform the join operation. The hashJoin method creates a HashMap to store the records from the first table, and then iterates through the second table to find matching records and add them to the result list. The result is then printed to the console.
