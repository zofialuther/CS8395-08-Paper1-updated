This Java code creates a simple Swing GUI application that displays a message "Goodbye, World!" in various components. The message is shown in an alert box using JOptionPane, on the title bar of a JFrame, in an editable area using JTextArea, and on a button using JButton. The components are added to the JFrame using a FlowLayout and the JFrame is set to close when the user clicks the close button. When the code is executed, the GUI will be displayed to the user.
