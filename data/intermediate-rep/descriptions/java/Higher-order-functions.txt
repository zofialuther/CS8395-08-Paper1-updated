This code creates a simple GUI application using Swing in Java. It creates a JButton with two different action listeners - one using an anonymous class and the other using a lambda expression. When the button is clicked, it will print a message to the console indicating which listener detected the click. The JFrame is set up to display the button, and the application will terminate when the JFrame is closed.
