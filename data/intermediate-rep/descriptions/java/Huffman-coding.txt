This Java code implements a Huffman coding algorithm to compress and encode a given string. It defines classes for Huffman trees, leaves, and nodes, and includes methods to build the Huffman tree, print the Huffman codes, and a main method to demonstrate the encoding process. The algorithm uses a priority queue to build the tree based on the frequency of characters in the input string. Finally, it prints out the Huffman code for each character along with its frequency.
