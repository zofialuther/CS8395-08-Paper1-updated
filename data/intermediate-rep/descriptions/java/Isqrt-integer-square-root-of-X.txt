This Java program calculates the integer square root of a given BigInteger using an iterative algorithm. It first checks if the input is negative and throws an exception if it is. Then, it iteratively computes the square root using a series of bitwise operations and comparisons. The main method demonstrates the usage of the isqrt function by calculating the square roots of integers from 0 to 65 and powers of 7 from 7^1 to 7^73, displaying the results in a formatted table.
