This Java code demonstrates the use of the Google Gson library to convert JSON data to Java objects and vice versa. It includes a main method that creates a Gson object, parses a JSON string into a MyJsonObject instance, and then prints the values of its properties. It also creates a new MyJsonObject instance, converts it to JSON, and prints the resulting JSON string. The MyJsonObject class represents a simple object with an integer property "foo" and a string array property "bar".
