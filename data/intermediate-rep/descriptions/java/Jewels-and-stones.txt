This Java code defines a class App with a method countJewels that takes two strings as input: stones and jewels. The method counts the number of jewels that appear in the stones string and returns the count. It uses a Set to store the unique characters in the jewels string and then iterates through the stones string to count the occurrences of the characters that are also present in the jewels set. The main method demonstrates the usage of the countJewels method with two different input strings and prints the results.
