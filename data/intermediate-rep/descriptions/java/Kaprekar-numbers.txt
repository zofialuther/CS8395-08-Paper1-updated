This Java code defines a class called Kaprekar and a main method to find Kaprekar numbers up to 1,000,000 in a given base. The code calculates the square of each number and then splits the square into two parts. It then checks if the sum of the two parts is equal to the original number. If it is, the number is considered a Kaprekar number and is printed to the console. The code also allows for the base to be specified as a command line argument.
