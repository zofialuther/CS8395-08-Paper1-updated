This Java program reads data from a file called "data.txt" and identifies and prints out lines that correspond to large earthquakes, defined as those with a magnitude greater than 6. It utilizes a BufferedReader to read the data and a FileReader to access the file. The program splits each line into its components, extracts the magnitude, and then checks if it meets the specified criteria before printing the line.
