This Java code calculates and prints the unsigned Lah numbers up to n = 12, as well as the maximum value of L(100, k). It uses a recursive function to compute the Lah numbers and stores the results in a cache to improve performance. The Lah numbers are calculated using the formula L(n, k) = (n-1+k)*L(n-1, k) + L(n-1, k-1) with base cases for when n = 0, k = 0, n = 1, and k = 1. The code utilizes BigInteger to handle large numbers and improve precision.
