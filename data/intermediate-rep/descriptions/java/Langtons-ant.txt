This Java code creates a simulation of Langton's Ant, a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. The program uses a JFrame to display a grid of cells, with each cell being colored either black or white. The main method initializes the simulation with a specified height and width, and the runAnt method controls the movement and behavior of the "ant" within the grid. The ant's movement causes the cells to change color, resulting in unique patterns and behavior.
