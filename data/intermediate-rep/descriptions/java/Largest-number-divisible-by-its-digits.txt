This Java program, named LynchBell, is designed to find the highest number with unique digits (excluding 0 and 5) that is also divisible by all its digits. It utilizes two main methods: uniqueDigits, which checks for the uniqueness of the digits in the number, and testNumber, which tests if the number is divisible by all its digits. The main method iterates through numbers, starting from 98764321, and checks for uniqueness and divisibility, printing the number if it meets the criteria.
