This Java program calculates and generates Pythagorean triples using the Law of Cosines. The main method calls two separate methods to generate triples, one for general cases and one for a specific case where the sides have different lengths. The program iterates through different values of 'a' and 'b' to find valid Pythagorean triples and prints the results. The output includes the maximum side length, the formula used, the generated triangles, and the total count of valid triangles for each case.
