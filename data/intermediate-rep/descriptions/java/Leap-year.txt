This Java code is a program called Leapyear that determines whether a given set of years are leap years. It contains a main method that initializes an array of years and a GregorianCalendar object. It then iterates through the array and prints whether each year is a leap year using the isLeapYear method and the GregorianCalendar's isLeapYear method. The isLeapYear method is defined to check if a year is a leap year by checking if it is divisible by 4, 100, and 400.
