This Java program calculates the left factorial of a given number using BigInteger to handle large numbers. The left factorial of a non-negative integer n is the sum of the factorials of all the non-negative integers less than or equal to n. The main method of the program demonstrates the calculation of left factorials for various input values and also displays the number of digits in the result for larger input values.
