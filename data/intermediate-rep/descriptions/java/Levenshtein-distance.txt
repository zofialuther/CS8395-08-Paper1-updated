The code defines a class called Levenshtein which contains a method to calculate the Levenshtein distance between two given strings. The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other. The main method demonstrates the use of the distance method by calculating the distances between pairs of strings in a given array and printing the results.
