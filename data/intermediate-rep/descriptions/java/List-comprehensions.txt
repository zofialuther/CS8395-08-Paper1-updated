This code is a Java interface for Pythagorean triple computation. It uses list comprehension to generate a list of Pythagorean triples (sets of three integers a, b, and c where a^2 + b^2 = c^2) within a specified range. The main method demonstrates how to use the run method to find Pythagorean triples up to a specified limit. The code utilizes Java streams and functional programming techniques to efficiently generate and filter the triples.
