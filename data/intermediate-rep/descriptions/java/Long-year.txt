This Java program, LongYear, calculates and prints the long years in the 21st century. A long year is defined as a year that has 53 weeks. The program uses the java.time.LocalDate and java.time.temporal.WeekFields classes to determine if a year is a long year. The main method iterates through the years from 2000 to 2099 and calls the longYear method to check if each year is a long year. If a year is determined to be a long year, it is printed to the console.
