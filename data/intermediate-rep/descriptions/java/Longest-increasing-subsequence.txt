This Java code implements the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm using a dynamic programming approach. The lis() method takes a List of elements and returns the Longest Increasing Subsequence of those elements. The algorithm sorts the elements into piles and then extracts the LIS from the nodes. The main method demonstrates the functionality by finding the LIS for two different sets of integers and printing the results.
