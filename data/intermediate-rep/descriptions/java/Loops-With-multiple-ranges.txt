This Java program, "LoopsWithMultipleRanges", calculates the sum and product of various ranges of numbers. It initializes a list of numbers using multiple for loops with different ranges, and then calculates the sum of the absolute values of the numbers and the product of non-zero numbers within a certain range. The program then prints out the sum, product, and the lists of numbers used for the sum and product calculations. The code also includes a method to calculate the power of a number.
