This Java program checks for Mersenne primes, which are prime numbers that can be expressed in the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. The code includes functions to check if a given number is prime, if a number is a Mersenne prime, and a main function that iterates through a specified range to find and display Mersenne primes. The upper bound for the range can be provided as a command line argument.
