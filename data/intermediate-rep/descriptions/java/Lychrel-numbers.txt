This Java program defines a class called Lychrel which calculates Lychrel numbers. The Lychrel numbers are non-palindromic numbers that when reversed and added to themselves, do not form a palindrome after a certain number of iterations. The program uses a HashMap to store previously calculated results and avoid redundant calculations. The main method of the program generates Lychrel numbers within a specified range and categorizes them as seeds, related numbers, and palindromes, printing the results at the end.
