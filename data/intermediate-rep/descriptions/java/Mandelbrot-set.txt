This code creates a program that generates the Mandelbrot Set, a famous mathematical fractal. It uses Java's graphics and image processing libraries to draw the set within a JFrame window. The program calculates the Mandelbrot set using a specified number of maximum iterations and a zoom factor, and then displays the resulting image using the paint method. The main method creates an instance of the Mandelbrot class and makes the window visible.
