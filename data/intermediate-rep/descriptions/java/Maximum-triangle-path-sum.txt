This Java program, MaxPathSum, reads a file called "triangle.txt" and processes the data to find the maximum sum of a path through the triangle. It uses the java.nio.file and java.util.Arrays libraries to read the file and manipulate the data. The program then iterates through the triangle from bottom to top, calculating the maximum path sum at each point and ultimately printing the maximum path sum at the top of the triangle.
