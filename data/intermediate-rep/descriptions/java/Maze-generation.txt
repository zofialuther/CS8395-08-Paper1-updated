The code is a Java implementation of a maze generator using a recursive backtracking algorithm. The algorithm creates a maze by recursively carving out pathways in a grid. The generated maze is then displayed using ASCII characters to represent the walls and passages. The main method allows for customization of the maze dimensions and displays the generated maze. The algorithm employs the use of shuffling and bitwise operations to create a unique maze layout each time it is generated.
