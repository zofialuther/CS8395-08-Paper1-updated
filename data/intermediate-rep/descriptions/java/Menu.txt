This code defines a method that takes in a list of strings and a prompt as input. It checks if the list is not empty, then iterates through the list and displays each element with an index. It then prompts the user to select an index and returns the corresponding string from the list. If the index is out of range, the user is prompted again until a valid index is selected. If the list is empty, an empty string is returned.
