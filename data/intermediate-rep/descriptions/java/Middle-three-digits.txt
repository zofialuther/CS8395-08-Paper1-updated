The code defines a class called MiddleThreeDigits and a main method that tests the functionality of the middleThreeDigits method. The method takes a number as input and returns the middle three digits of the number as a string. The main method tests the method with various input values and prints the results. It also includes arrays of passing and failing test cases to verify the functionality of the method. If the input number has less than 3 digits or an even number of digits, the method returns a message indicating the requirement for odd and at least 3 digits.
