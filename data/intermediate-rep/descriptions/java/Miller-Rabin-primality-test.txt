This Java class contains methods for testing whether a given number is a prime number using the Rabin-Miller primality test algorithm. The `isPrime` method takes a `BigInteger` input and an optional precision value, and uses the Rabin-Miller test to determine if the input number is prime. The class also provides overloaded `isPrime` methods to handle `int` and `long` inputs by converting them to `BigInteger` and calling the main `isPrime` method. The algorithm is deterministic for numbers less than 341,550,071,728,321 and uses a set of prime numbers to test for compositeness.
