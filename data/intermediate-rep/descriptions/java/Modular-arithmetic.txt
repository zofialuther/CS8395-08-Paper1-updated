This code defines a class called ModularArithmetic that implements modular arithmetic operations using a generic ring interface. It includes methods for addition, multiplication, obtaining the value, and raising a ring to a power. It also includes a nested class called ModInt that represents a modular integer and implements the ring interface. The main method demonstrates the usage of the ModInt class by performing a calculation and printing the result.
