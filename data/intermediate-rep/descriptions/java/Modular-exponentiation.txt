This Java code defines a class called PowMod and a main method that uses the BigInteger class to perform modular exponentiation. It initializes three BigInteger variables a, b, and m with large numbers and then calculates a raised to the power of b modulo m using the modPow method. The result is then printed to the console. This code is useful for performing large number calculations efficiently and accurately.
