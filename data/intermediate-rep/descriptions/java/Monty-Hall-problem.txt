This Java program simulates the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle. It uses a random number generator to create a scenario where the player chooses a door, one door is shown to not contain the prize, and then the player can either stick with their original choice or switch to the remaining door. The program runs through this scenario 32768 times and keeps track of how many wins occur when the player switches doors versus when they stay with their original choice. The results are then printed to the console.
