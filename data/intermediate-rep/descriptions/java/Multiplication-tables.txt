This code creates a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 12. It first prints the header row with the numbers 1 through 12, then adds a separator line. After that, it prints the multiplication table, with each row starting with the number being multiplied and the subsequent columns showing the results of multiplying that number by 1 through 12. The code also includes formatting to align the numbers neatly in the table.
