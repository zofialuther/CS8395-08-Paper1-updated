This Java code includes a class called MultiSplit with a main method that demonstrates the use of both regex split and manual split methods. The regex split method splits a given string "a!===b=!=c" based on the regular expression pattern "==|!=|=". The manual split method uses a custom multiSplit function to split the same string using an array of separators "==", "!=", and "=". The multiSplit function iterates through the string and splits it based on the provided separators, storing the results in a list. The code showcases different approaches to splitting strings in Java.
