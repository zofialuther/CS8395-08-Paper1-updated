This Java code creates a JFrame with a custom panel that displays a XOR pattern. The pattern is created by iterating through the width and height of the panel and using the XOR operation to calculate the color value for each pixel. The resulting color is then used to draw a line at each pixel, creating the XOR pattern effect. The JFrame is set to be visible and will close when the user exits the application.
