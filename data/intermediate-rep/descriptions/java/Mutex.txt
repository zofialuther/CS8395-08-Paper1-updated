This code defines a Java class called VolatileClass that uses a Semaphore to provide synchronization for methods that need to be accessed by multiple threads. The Semaphore is initialized with a single permit, allowing only one thread to access the synchronized method at a time. The class also includes the potential for adding delegate methods for acquiring and releasing the mutex. This ensures that concurrent access to the synchronized method is controlled and managed effectively.
