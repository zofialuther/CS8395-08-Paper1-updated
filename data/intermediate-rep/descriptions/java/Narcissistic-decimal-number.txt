This Java program calculates and prints the first 25 narcissistic numbers. A narcissistic number, also known as an Armstrong number, is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The program uses a stream of integers to iterate through all possible numbers, calculates the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits, and prints the narcissistic numbers until the specified count is reached.
