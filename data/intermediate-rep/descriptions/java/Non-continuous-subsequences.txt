This Java program generates all non-continuous subsequences of a given string. The main method calls the seqR method with the initial parameters. The seqR method recursively generates all possible non-continuous subsequences by either including the current character or adding a space to represent exclusion. Once all combinations have been generated, the method prints any non-empty subsequences.
