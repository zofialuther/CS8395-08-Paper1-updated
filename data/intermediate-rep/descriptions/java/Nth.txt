This Java code defines a class called Nth, which contains a method called ordinalAbbrev that takes an integer input and returns the appropriate ordinal abbreviation (e.g. "st" for 1st, "nd" for 2nd, "rd" for 3rd, and "th" for all other numbers). The main method demonstrates the functionality of the ordinalAbbrev method by printing out a series of numbers along with their corresponding ordinal abbreviations.
