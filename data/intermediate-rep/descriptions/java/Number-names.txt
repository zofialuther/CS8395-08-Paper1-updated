The int2Text method takes a long number as input and returns the equivalent words in English. It handles both positive and negative numbers, converting them into words and accounting for thousands, millions, billions, and so on. The code uses arrays to store the words for small numbers, tens, and big numbers. The main method tests the int2Text method with various input numbers and prints the results. Overall, this code provides a way to convert integer numbers into their word representations.
