This code represents a simple game in which the player is presented with a list of numbers from 1 to 9 in random order and is tasked with sorting them in ascending order using a series of reversals. The player can input the index of the number to be reversed, and the game will display the updated list after each move. The game continues until the list is sorted, and the number of moves taken to solve the puzzle is then displayed. The code utilizes the Java Collections framework to manipulate the list and check for sorting.
