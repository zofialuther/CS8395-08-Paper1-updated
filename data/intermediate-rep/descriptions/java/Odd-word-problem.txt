This code creates a program called OddWord that processes input from the user. It defines a CharHandler interface and implements it with a forward and reverse character handling functionality. The code also includes a Reverser class that extends Thread and handles the reverse processing of characters. The main method initiates the program and enters a loop to continuously process input from the user.
