This code represents a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton. It starts by defining an initial state and then simulates the evolution of this state over a specified number of generations. The `life` method is responsible for calculating the next generation based on the rules of the game, which involve counting the number of neighboring cells and determining whether a cell lives, dies, or is born. The `getNeighbors` method is used to count the number of live neighbors for a given cell. The main method initializes the starting state and iterates through the specified number of generations, printing the state of each generation to the console.
