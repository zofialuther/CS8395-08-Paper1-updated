This code defines a method called "pali" that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards. It uses a StringBuilder to reverse the input string and then compares it to the original string to determine if it is a palindrome. The method returns true if the input string is a palindrome and false otherwise.
