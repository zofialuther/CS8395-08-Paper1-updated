This Java program is designed to find and display palindromic gapful numbers, which are numbers that are both palindromic (read the same forwards and backwards) and gapful (divisible by the concatenation of their first and last digit). The main method calls the getPalindromicGapfulEnding method to retrieve and display the first 20 palindromic gapful numbers ending in 20, the last 15 of the first 100 palindromic gapful numbers, and the last 10 of the first 1000 palindromic gapful numbers. The program uses various helper methods to check for gapfulness, calculate the length of a number, find the next palindrome, and reverse a number.
