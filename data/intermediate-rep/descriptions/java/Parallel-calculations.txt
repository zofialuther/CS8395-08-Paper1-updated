This code defines an interface called ParallelCalculations with a constant array of numbers. The main method uses parallel stream processing to find the minimal prime factor of each number in the array. It then finds the number with the largest minimal prime factor and outputs the result. The minimalPrimeFactor method is also defined to calculate the minimal prime factor of a given number.
