This Java code implements a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions. It takes a string representing an RPN expression as input and processes it to perform the required operations. The code uses a LinkedList to simulate a stack data structure, and it iterates through the expression tokens, carrying out the specified operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation) while updating the stack accordingly. If an invalid token is encountered, it prints an error message and exits. Finally, it prints the final result of the RPN expression.
