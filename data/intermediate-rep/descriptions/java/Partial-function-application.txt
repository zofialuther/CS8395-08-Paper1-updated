This code demonstrates the concept of partial application in Java. It defines two functional interfaces, IntegerFunction and SequenceFunction, and a method fs() that applies a function to an array of integers. It then creates two instances of IntegerFunction, f1 and f2, and uses the fs() method to partially apply these functions to arrays of integers. The main method showcases the partial application by applying the partially applied functions to different arrays and printing the results. This code illustrates how partial application can be used to create new functions by fixing some of the parameters of an existing function.
