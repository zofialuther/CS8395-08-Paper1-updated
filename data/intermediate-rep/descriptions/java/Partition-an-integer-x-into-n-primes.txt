This Java program contains methods to partition an integer into a sum of prime numbers. It first generates an array of prime numbers using a sieve method. The `isPrime` method checks if a number is prime, and the `findCombo` method recursively finds combinations of prime numbers that add up to the given integer. The `partition` method filters the prime numbers array and then uses the `findCombo` method to search for combinations. The `main` method demonstrates the functionality by partitioning various integers into sums of prime numbers.
