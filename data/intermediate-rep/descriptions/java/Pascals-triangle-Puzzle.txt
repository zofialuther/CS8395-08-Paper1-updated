This Java program is a solver for a system of linear equations using Cramer's Rule. It defines a class called PascalsTrianglePuzzle with a main method that creates a matrix and a vector, solves the system using Cramer's Rule, and prints out the solution. The Matrix class represents a matrix and provides methods for calculating its determinant, cofactor, and replacing columns. The program demonstrates the use of Cramer's Rule for solving systems of linear equations.
