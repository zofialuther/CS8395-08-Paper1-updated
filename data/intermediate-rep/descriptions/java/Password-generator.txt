This code is a Java program that generates random passwords of a specified length and quantity. It takes input from the command line for the length and number of passwords to generate, and then uses a random character set to create unique passwords. The program ensures that the length and quantity of passwords provided are within the specified limits and handles any exceptions by prompting the user to input valid values. The generated passwords are then printed to the console. The code also includes a method to shuffle the characters in the passwords for added security.
