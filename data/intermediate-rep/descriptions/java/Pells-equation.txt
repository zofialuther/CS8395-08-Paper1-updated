This code is a Java program that calculates the solutions to Pell's equation, which is a type of Diophantine equation. The main method loops through a set of predetermined values of n and uses the pellsEquation method to calculate the corresponding values of x and y that satisfy the equation x^2 - n * y^2 = 1. The pellsEquation method uses continued fractions to iteratively calculate the solutions, and the iterateFrac method is used to perform the calculations for the continued fractions. The program then prints out the results in a formatted manner.
