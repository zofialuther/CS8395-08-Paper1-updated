This Java program, PenneysGame, simulates a two-player game where the computer and the player take turns choosing a sequence of three coin tosses (either heads or tails). The program uses a random number generator to determine the initial choice of the computer. Then, it prompts the player to make their choice. The program then simulates a series of coin tosses until one of the sequences chosen by the player or the computer appears at the end of the tosses. The program then prints out the result, declaring the winner of the game. The player's input is validated to ensure it is a valid sequence of three coin tosses and is not the same as the computer's choice.
