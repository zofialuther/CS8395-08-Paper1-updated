This Java code calculates the digits of the mathematical constant pi using the Gauss-Legendre algorithm. It initializes several BigInteger variables and then enters a while loop to continuously compute and print the digits of pi. The algorithm involves several mathematical operations and conditions to update the values of the variables and calculate the next digit of pi. The main method creates an instance of the Pi class and calls the calcPiDigits method to start the calculation process.
