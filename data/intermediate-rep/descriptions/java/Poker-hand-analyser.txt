This Java code is a PokerHandAnalyzer class that can analyze regular poker hands as well as hands with wildcards. It includes a main method that demonstrates the analysis of different test hands, both regular and with wildcards. The analyzeHand method evaluates the strength of the poker hand and returns a Score object with the hand's name, weight, and the actual cards. The analyzeHandWithWildcards method handles hands with wildcards, using recursion to replace the wildcards with all possible card combinations and then selecting the best hand based on its strength. The buildDeck method creates a standard deck of playing cards. The code also includes inner classes Score and WildScore to store and display the results of the analysis. Overall, this code provides a powerful tool for analyzing poker hands in a Java program.
