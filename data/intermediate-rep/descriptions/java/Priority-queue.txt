This code creates a Priority Queue of Task objects, each with a priority and a name. The Task class implements the Comparable interface to define the priority order. The main method creates a Priority Queue, adds several tasks with different priorities, and then removes and prints each task in order of priority until the queue is empty. This code demonstrates how to use a Priority Queue to manage and process tasks based on their priority levels.
