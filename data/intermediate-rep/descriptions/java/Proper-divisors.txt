This Java code defines a class called Proper with a method called properDivs that takes an integer as input and returns a list of its proper divisors. The main method then uses properDivs to print the proper divisors of the numbers 1 through 10 and to find the number between 1 and 20000 with the most proper divisors, along with the count of its proper divisors. The code uses a LinkedList and the Collections class to store and sort the divisors.
