The code is a Java program that calculates the number of Pythagorean triples (sets of three positive integers a, b, and c that satisfy the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2) with a perimeter less than or equal to a given limit. The program uses a recursive function called parChild to generate the triples and counts the total number of triples and the number of primitive triples (triples in which a, b, and c are coprime) for different limits ranging from 100 to 10,000,000. The program utilizes the BigInteger class to handle large integer values and optimize the calculations.
