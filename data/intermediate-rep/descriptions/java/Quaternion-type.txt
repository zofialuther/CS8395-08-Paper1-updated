This code defines a Quaternion class with methods for performing mathematical operations on quaternions, such as calculating the norm, finding the negative, conjugate, addition, multiplication, and comparing quaternions. It also includes a main method to demonstrate the functionality of the Quaternion class by creating instances of quaternions and performing various operations on them. The code provides a comprehensive implementation of quaternion operations and demonstrates their use through the main method.
