This Java code defines a `RangeConsolidation` class that contains a `main` method to test the functionality of range consolidation. The code also includes a nested `Range` class, which represents a range of double values with a left and right bound. The `Range` class has a `consolidate` method to consolidate overlapping ranges and a `consolidate` method that takes a list of ranges and consolidates them into a single list of non-overlapping ranges. The code also includes a `RangeSorter` class that implements the `Comparator` interface to sort ranges based on their left bound. The `main` method tests the range consolidation functionality with various input ranges and displays the original and consolidated ranges.
