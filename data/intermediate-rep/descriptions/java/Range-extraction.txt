This Java code defines a class called RangeExtraction and a main method to demonstrate the functionality. The code initializes an array with a series of numbers. It then iterates through the array to identify consecutive numbers and prints the ranges of consecutive numbers in a formatted manner. If there are less than 3 consecutive numbers, it prints each individual number. This code effectively extracts and prints ranges of consecutive numbers from the given array.
