This Java code defines a class called ReadAll, which contains two static methods for reading the contents of a file. The readAllLines method takes a filename as input and returns a list of all the lines in the file, using the default character encoding. The readAllBytes method also takes a filename as input and returns an array of bytes containing the entire contents of the file. The code makes use of the java.nio.file package for working with files and paths.
