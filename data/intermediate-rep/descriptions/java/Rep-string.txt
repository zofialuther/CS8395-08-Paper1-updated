This Java program defines a class called RepStrings that contains a main method. In the main method, a list of binary strings is defined, and then a function called repString is used to find the longest repeated substrings within each binary string. The program then prints out the original string and the longest repeated substring found for each input. The repString function iterates through the input string and checks for repeated substrings of increasing length, adding any found repetitions to a list. If no repetitions are found, "Not a rep-string" is printed for that particular input.
