This Java code defines a class called Reverse that contains a method graphemeReverse, which takes a string as input and reverses it at the grapheme level (taking into account characters and their associated diacritics). It uses the BreakIterator class to identify the boundaries of graphemes within the input string and then constructs a StringBuilder to store the reversed graphemes. The main method demonstrates the functionality by reversing a sample input string and printing the result. Additionally, it includes a note indicating that the code is only compatible with Java 20 and later due to a known issue in earlier versions.
