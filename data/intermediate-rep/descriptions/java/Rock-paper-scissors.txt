This Java code is a program for playing a simple version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It uses an EnumMap to keep track of the counts for each choice (rock, paper, scissors), and allows the user to input their choice through the console. The program then generates a random choice for the computer and compares the two choices to determine the winner. The program continues to prompt the user for their choice until the user decides to stop playing.
