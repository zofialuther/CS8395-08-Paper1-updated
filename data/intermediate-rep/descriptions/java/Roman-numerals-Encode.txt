This Java program defines a class RN with a nested enum Numeral that represents Roman numerals and their corresponding values. The class includes a method roman() that converts a given long integer into a Roman numeral string, and a test() method to demonstrate the conversion. The main() method calls the test() method with different input values to verify the functionality of the roman() method.
