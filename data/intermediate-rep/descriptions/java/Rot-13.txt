This Java program implements a simple encryption algorithm called ROT13. It takes input from either command-line arguments or standard input, applies the ROT13 encryption, and then outputs the result to the standard output. The ROT13 algorithm shifts each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. The program can be used to encrypt or decrypt text files using the ROT13 algorithm.
