This Java code implements the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to generate a message digest for the input "Rosetta Code". The SHA1 class contains the logic for processing the message and generating the hash value, while the SHA1Task class contains the main method to execute the hashing process. The code utilizes bitwise operations, padding, and an array of integers to perform the hashing algorithm. The result is a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value in hexadecimal format.
