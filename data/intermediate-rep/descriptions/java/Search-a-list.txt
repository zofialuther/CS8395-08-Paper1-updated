This code uses the Arrays class to perform a binary search on a String array called haystack. It searches for two different strings, "Washington" and "Bush", within the haystack array. If the string is not found, it prints a message indicating that the string is not in the haystack. If the string is found, it prints the index of the string in the haystack along with the string itself.
