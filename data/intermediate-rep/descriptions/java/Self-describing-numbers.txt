This code defines a class called SelfDescribingNumbers with a method isSelfDescribing that determines whether a given integer is a self-describing number. A self-describing number is a number where the digit at each index indicates the number of times that digit appears in the number. The main method iterates through numbers up to 100,000,000 and prints out any self-describing numbers it finds.
