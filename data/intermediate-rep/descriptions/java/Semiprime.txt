This Java code defines a class called SemiPrime, which contains methods for decomposing a BigInteger into its prime factors and checking if a number is a semi-prime (the product of two prime numbers). The primeDecomp method takes a BigInteger input and returns a list of its prime factors, while the isSemi method checks if a number is a semi-prime. The main method demonstrates the use of these methods by finding semi-prime numbers between 2 and 100, and between 1675 and 1680.
