This code demonstrates the use of sets in Java, specifically TreeSet, and showcases various set operations. It creates four TreeSet objects and populates them with integer values. It then performs operations such as union, difference, intersection, and checking for subsets and equality between sets. Additionally, it includes examples of creating an empty and immutable set, testing for emptiness, and checking for common elements between sets. The code provides a comprehensive overview of set manipulation and usage in Java.
