This Java code defines a class called SexyPrimes, which contains a main method that calculates and displays the counts and lists of sexy primes, triples, and quadruplets within a given range. It uses the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to a specified maximum value. The code then iterates through the list of primes to identify and count the occurrences of sexy pairs, triples, and quadruplets, as well as unsexy primes. The results are printed to the console in a formatted manner, along with the corresponding lists of prime numbers.
