This code is a command-line instruction to create and run a simple Java program. The 'echo' command creates a new file named X.java containing a public class with a main method that prints "Hello Java!". The 'javac' command compiles the X.java file into a .class file, and the 'java' command executes the program, resulting in the output "Hello Java!".
