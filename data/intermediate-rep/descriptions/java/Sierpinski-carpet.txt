This Java code creates a Sierpinski Carpet fractal using Java Swing. The Sierpinski Carpet is drawn within a JPanel with a specified dimension and margin. The code uses a Timer to continuously update the size of the carpet and repaint it. The drawCarpet method recursively draws the Sierpinski Carpet pattern. The main method creates a JFrame and adds the SierpinskiCarpet JPanel to it, displaying the fractal when the program is run.
