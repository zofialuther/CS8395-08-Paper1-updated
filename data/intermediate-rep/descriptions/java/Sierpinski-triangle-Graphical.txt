This code creates a program that draws a Sierpinsky Triangle in a JFrame. The level of complexity for the triangle is specified from the command line, defaulting to 3 if no value is provided. The triangle is drawn using Java's Swing library, with the main method setting up the JFrame and panel, and the drawSierpinskyTriangle method recursively drawing the triangles. The program allows for customization of the complexity level and provides a visual representation of the Sierpinsky Triangle.
