This Java code generates a Sierpinski Triangle pattern using recursion. The main method calls the getSierpinskiTriangle method with a specified level of recursion. The getSierpinskiTriangle method uses a recursive approach to build the Sierpinski Triangle pattern, starting from a base case of n=0, and then building the triangle by combining smaller triangles. The buildSpace method is used to create spaces for formatting the triangle pattern. The code utilizes StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation and split method to split the triangle into parts for further processing. Overall, this code generates a Sierpinski Triangle pattern with the specified level of recursion.
