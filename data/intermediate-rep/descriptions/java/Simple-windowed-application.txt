This Java code creates a simple GUI application that tracks the number of button clicks. It uses the Swing library to create a window with a label displaying the current click count and a button to increment the count. The code sets up event handling for the button click and updates the label accordingly. The layout is managed using BorderLayout, and the window is displayed using JFrame. The main method ensures that the GUI is created on the Event Dispatch Thread for thread safety. Overall, the code creates a user-friendly interface for counting button clicks.
