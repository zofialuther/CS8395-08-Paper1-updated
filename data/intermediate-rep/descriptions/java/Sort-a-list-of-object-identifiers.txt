This Java code is a program that demonstrates how to sort a list of object identifiers (OIDs) in ascending order. The code defines a custom comparator that splits the OIDs into individual numbers and compares them to determine their order. It then creates a stream of OIDs and uses the custom comparator to sort them before printing the sorted list to the console. This code showcases the use of Java's Comparator and Stream API for sorting and processing data.
