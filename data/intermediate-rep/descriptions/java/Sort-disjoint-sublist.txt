This Java code defines a class `Disjoint` with a method `sortDisjoint` that takes a list of comparable elements and an array of indices. It sorts the elements at the specified indices in the list and then updates the original list with the sorted elements. The `main` method demonstrates the functionality by creating a list of integers and sorting specific elements at given indices.
