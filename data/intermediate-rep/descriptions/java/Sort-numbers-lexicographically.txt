This Java program defines a class called LexicographicalNumbers, which includes a method called lexOrder that generates a list of integers in lexicographical order based on the input parameter n. The main method prints the lexicographically ordered lists for a set of example input integers. The program uses Java's Stream API to efficiently perform the sorting and conversion of integers to strings and vice versa.
