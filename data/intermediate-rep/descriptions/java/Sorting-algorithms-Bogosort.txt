This code implements the BogoSort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The main method initializes an array and then creates an instance of the BogoSort class to perform the sorting. The bogo method repeatedly shuffles the array using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm until the array is sorted. The number of shuffles required to sort the array is then displayed. The code also includes methods for shuffling the array, checking if the array is sorted, and displaying the contents of the array.
