This code implements the cocktail sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The algorithm works by repeatedly passing through the array in both directions, swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is fully sorted. The cocktailSort method takes an integer array A as input and modifies it in place to sort its elements.
