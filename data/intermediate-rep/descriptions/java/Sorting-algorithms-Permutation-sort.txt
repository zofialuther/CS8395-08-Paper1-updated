This Java program implements the Permutation Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The main method initializes an unsorted array, calls the pSort method to sort the array, and then prints the sorted array. The pSort method generates all permutations of the input array and checks each permutation for sorted order using the isSorted method. The permute method recursively generates all permutations of the input array, and the swap method is used to swap elements in the array during permutation.
