This Java program uses the concept of sleep sorting to sort an array of integers and then print them in ascending order. Sleep sorting works by creating a separate thread for each number in the array, and then using the Thread.sleep method to delay the printing of each number based on its value. The CountDownLatch class is used to ensure that all threads have completed before the numbers are printed. The main method takes input from the command line and passes the array of integers to the sleepSortAndPrint method.
