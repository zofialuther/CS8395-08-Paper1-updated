This code is a Java program that implements the Soundex algorithm, a phonetic algorithm used to index words by their sound when pronounced in English. The main method calls the soundex method with different words as input and prints their respective Soundex codes. The soundex method takes a string as input and returns its Soundex code. It uses the getCode method to assign numeric codes to each letter based on the Soundex rules, and then applies the algorithm to generate the final Soundex code for the input string.
