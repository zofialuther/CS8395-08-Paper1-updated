This Java program defines a class called SpellingOfOrdinalNumbers, which includes a main method that iterates through an array of long numbers and prints their corresponding ordinal representation. The program also includes a method toOrdinal that converts a long number into its ordinal form using a map to handle specific cases, as well as helper methods to convert numbers into their string representation. The code uses recursion and string manipulation to achieve its functionality.
