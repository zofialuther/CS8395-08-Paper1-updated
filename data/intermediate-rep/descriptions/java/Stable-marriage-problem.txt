This code simulates the stable marriage problem, where a set of men and women have preferences for each other and the goal is to find a stable match. It uses the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find a stable matching and then checks if the resulting marriages are stable. If they are not, it swaps partners for two of the women and checks again for stability. The code includes methods for matching the preferences of men and women and for checking the stability of the resulting marriages.
