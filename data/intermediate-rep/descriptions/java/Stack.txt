This Java program demonstrates the use of the Stack class to create and manipulate a stack data structure. The program creates a stack of strings and performs operations such as pushing elements onto the stack, checking if the stack is empty, and popping elements from the stack. It also includes an example of popping from an empty stack, which will result in an exception. This code serves as a basic introduction to using the Stack class in Java.
