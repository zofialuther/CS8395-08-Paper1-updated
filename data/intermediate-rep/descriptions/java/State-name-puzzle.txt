This Java program is a puzzle solver that takes a list of US state names and finds pairs of states that can be combined to form an anagram. The program uses streams to create a map of the original state names, removes spaces and converts them to lowercase. It then iterates through the list of state names, creates pairs of states, and checks for anagrams by sorting the characters and creating a key for each pair. It then checks for unique combinations and prints out the pairs of states that form anagrams.
