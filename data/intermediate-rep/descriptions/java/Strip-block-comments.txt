This Java code defines a class called StripBlockComments with methods for reading a file, stripping block comments from the file, and a main method to execute the functionality. The readFile method reads the contents of a file, while the stripComments method removes block comments delimited by specified begin and end tokens. The main method takes command line arguments for the begin and end tokens, as well as the file to process, and then prints out the file contents with block comments stripped. The code also includes error handling for file reading and processing.
