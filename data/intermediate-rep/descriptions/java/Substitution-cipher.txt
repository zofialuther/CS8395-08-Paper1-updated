This Java code defines a SubstitutionCipher class that includes a main method to demonstrate the functionality of encoding and decoding a given text using a predetermined key. The key consists of a string of characters used for substitution. The encode method takes a string input and replaces each character with the corresponding character from the key, while the decode method reverses this process to restore the original text. The main method showcases the output of the encoded and decoded text. This code showcases a basic example of a substitution cipher encryption and decryption scheme.
