This Java program demonstrates two different ways to remove specific characters from the beginning and end of a string. The first method uses the substring() method to select a specific substring and exclude the first and last characters. The second method uses the replaceAll() method with regular expressions to achieve the same result. The program prints the modified strings for the words "knight", "socks", and "brooms" using both methods.
