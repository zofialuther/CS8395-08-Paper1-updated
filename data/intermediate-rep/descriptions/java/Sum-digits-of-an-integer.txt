This Java program defines a class called SumDigits, which contains methods for calculating the sum of the digits in a given number. The class includes overloaded methods to handle both primitive long numbers and arbitrary-precision BigInteger numbers. The sumDigits method takes a number as input and returns the sum of its digits in the given base. The main method demonstrates the usage of the sumDigits method with different input values, including long numbers, hexadecimal numbers, and BigInteger numbers.
