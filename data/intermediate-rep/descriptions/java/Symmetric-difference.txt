This Java code calculates the symmetric difference between two sets of strings, setA and setB. It first presents the initial data sets, then calculates the symmetric difference using two different methods: the union of differences and the union minus intersection. The results are then presented, showing the elements that are not in setA, not in setB, and the symmetric difference using both methods.
