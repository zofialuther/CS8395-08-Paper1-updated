This Java program defines a class called NameGame with a method printVerse that generates a playful verse using the input name. The verse follows a specific format where the name is manipulated and incorporated into rhyming phrases. The main method then uses a stream to pass a list of names to the printVerse method, generating and printing the verses for each name in the list.
