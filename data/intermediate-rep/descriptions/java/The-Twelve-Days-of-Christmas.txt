This Java program represents the classic Christmas carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas." It uses arrays to store the gifts and the corresponding days, and then utilizes nested loops to print out the lyrics of the song, starting with "On the first day of Christmas" and continuing through to "On the twelfth day of Christmas." The program prints out the gifts received on each day, following the pattern of the song.
