This Java program, TopRankPerGroup, reads employee records from a file and sorts them by department and salary. It then prints out the top N earners for each department. The program takes an optional command line argument to specify the number of top earners to display. The employee records are stored in a Map, with the department as the key and a list of employees as the value. The program then iterates through the map, sorting the list of employees by salary and printing out the top earners for each department.
