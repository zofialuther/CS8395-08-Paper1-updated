This Java code defines a class called TreeTraversal that includes a nested static class Node, which represents a node in a binary tree. The class also includes an enum called ORDER with four values: PREORDER, INORDER, POSTORDER, and LEVEL. The main method creates a binary tree with nodes containing integer values and then traverses the tree in each of the four different orders using the traverse method. The traverse method uses recursion for PREORDER, INORDER, and POSTORDER traversal, and a queue for LEVEL traversal. This code demonstrates the different ways to traverse a binary tree in Java.
