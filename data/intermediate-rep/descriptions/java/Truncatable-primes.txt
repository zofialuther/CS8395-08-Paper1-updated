This Java code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a specified maximum value. It then searches for the largest left and right truncatable prime numbers within that range, and prints the results. Left truncatable primes are those where removing digits from the left still results in a prime number, and right truncatable primes are those where removing digits from the right still results in a prime number. The code uses a BitSet to efficiently store and manipulate the list of prime numbers.
