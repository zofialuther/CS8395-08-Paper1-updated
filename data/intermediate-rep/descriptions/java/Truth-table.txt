This Java code defines a TruthTable class that can generate truth tables for logical expressions. It includes a main method to print the truth table for a given set of symbols. The class also contains a map of supported logical operators and their corresponding evaluation functions. The toString method generates the truth table by recursively generating true and false values for the variables and then evaluating the expression for each set of values. The evaluate method evaluates the expression for a set of values using a stack and the supported logical operators.
