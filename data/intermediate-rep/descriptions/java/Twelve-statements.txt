This Java code represents a logic puzzle solver. The program contains a series of boolean checks that need to be satisfied in order to solve the puzzle. The main method initializes the puzzle and runs a recursive function to test all possible combinations of boolean values. Once all checks are passed, the program prints out the solution and the total number of solutions found.
