This Java code defines a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) that can simulate the behavior of any other Turing machine. It includes classes for StateTapeSymbolPair and Transition, as well as methods for initializing the tape and running the machine. The UTM can be instantiated with a set of transitions, terminal states, initial state, and a blank symbol. The main method demonstrates the use of the UTM to perform simple tasks like incrementing numbers, as well as more complex operations such as the Busy Beaver problem and sorting.
