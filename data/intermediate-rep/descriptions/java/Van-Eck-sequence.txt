This Java program generates and prints the first 10 terms of Van Eck's sequence, as well as terms 991 to 1000. The Van Eck sequence is a mathematical sequence where each term is determined based on the previous term. The program uses a HashMap to efficiently store and retrieve previously calculated values in order to generate the sequence. The vanEck method takes in the first and last index to determine which terms of the sequence to calculate and print.
