This code defines a class called VanDerCorput with a method vdc that calculates and returns the Van der Corput sequence for a given integer input. The main method then uses this vdc method to print the Van der Corput sequence for integers from 0 to 10. The Van der Corput sequence is a way of generating a low-discrepancy sequence of points in a one-dimensional space, commonly used in numerical integration and Monte Carlo simulations.
