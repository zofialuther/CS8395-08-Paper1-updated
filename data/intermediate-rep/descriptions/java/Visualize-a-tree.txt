This code creates a Binary Search Tree and inserts 20 random integers into it. It then displays the tree in a visual format, using ASCII characters to represent the nodes and connections. The main method initializes the tree, inserts values, and calls the display method to visualize the structure of the tree. The BinarySearchTree class contains methods for insertion and displaying the tree, as well as a private inner Node class for creating node objects. The display method uses recursive calls to build the visual representation of the tree.
