This Java code creates a Voronoi diagram using random points and colors. The program generates a grid of cells and assigns each cell a random color. It then calculates the distance between each pixel and the random points to determine which color to fill the pixel with. The diagram is then displayed in a window and saved as a PNG file. The distance calculation can be customized using different formulas such as Euclidian, Manhattan, or Minkovski.
