This code defines a method called printWordFrequency that reads a text file from a given URL and counts the frequency of each word. It uses regular expressions to split the text into words, and then stores the frequency of each word in a HashMap. After processing the entire file, it sorts the words by frequency and prints out the top 10 most frequent words along with their counts. This code handles exceptions related to accessing the URL and reading the file.
