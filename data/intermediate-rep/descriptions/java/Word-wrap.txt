This Java code defines a WordWrap class that can wrap a given text to fit within a specified line width. The class includes a method to wrap the text with the default line width of 80 characters, and another method to wrap the text with a custom line width. The main method demonstrates the usage of the WordWrap class by wrapping a long passage of text with both the default and a custom line width. The code utilizes the StringTokenizer class to split the input text into individual words and then formats them to fit within the specified line width.
