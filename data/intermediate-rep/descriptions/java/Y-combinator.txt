This Java code implements the Y combinator, a higher-order function that allows for the definition of recursive functions in a functional programming style. The YCombinator interface contains a method Y which takes a function as an argument and returns a new function. The main method demonstrates the usage of the Y combinator to define and calculate the Fibonacci and factorial functions, using recursive function definitions. The output of the main method is the result of applying the Fibonacci and factorial functions to the input value of 10.
