The given code is a Java implementation of a solution to the Zebra puzzle, also known as the Einstein riddle. The Zebra puzzle is a logic puzzle that involves matching a group of people with a set of houses, colors, and pets based on a set of clues. The code defines a Zebra class with a nested Solver class that utilizes a set of constraints and rules to solve the puzzle. The Solver class iterates through all possible combinations of the puzzle lines, validates them against the constraints, and recursively checks for valid solutions. Finally, the code prints the results of the puzzle solution. The implementation uses custom data structures and methods to handle the puzzle constraints and rules effectively.
