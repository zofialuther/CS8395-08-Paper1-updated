This code defines a game called play24, which takes in three parameters: Len, Range, and Goal. It then calls the game predicate with these parameters to generate a list of expressions and their results. The code then prints each expression and its result using the my_write predicate. The game predicate generates a list of random numbers based on the Len and Range parameters, and then computes the expressions and their results using the compute predicate. The compute predicate recursively computes the result of combining the numbers using various mathematical operations and keeps track of the expressions used to get to each result. The code also includes predicates for writing the expressions in tree format and for choosing random numbers within a specified range. Overall, this code is a logic puzzle game that generates and solves mathematical expressions to reach a target goal.
