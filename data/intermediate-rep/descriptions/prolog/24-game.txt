This code is a simple game where the player is prompted to solve a series of math problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The game generates a set of four random digits and the player must use those digits to reach a target number (24 in this case) using the four basic operations. The player can keep playing as long as they want, and the program will indicate whether their answer is correct or not.
