This Prolog code uses the Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLPFD) library to define a main predicate my_sum, which takes a minimum value, maximum value, a top value, and a list of lists as input. Inside the predicate, a list L is defined with seven variables, which are constrained to be within the specified minimum and maximum values. Depending on the value of Top, the variables in the list L are either required to be distinct or not. Then, a series of arithmetic constraints are applied to the variables in L. Finally, the predicate uses the setof/3 built-in predicate to find all possible solutions for L and store them in the output list LL.

Additionally, two helper predicates my_sum_1 and my_sum_2 are defined, which call the main predicate my_sum with different values for the top parameter and manipulate the resulting list of lists in different ways.

Overall, this code performs arithmetic operations and constraint satisfaction using CLPFD to find all possible solutions to a set of constraints and store them in a list of lists.
