This code defines a Prolog predicate abc_problem that takes a list of words as input and checks if each word can be formed using a specific set of letter pairs. The code uses a list L to define pairs of letters that can be used to form words. The main abc_problem predicate then checks each word in the input list to see if it can be formed using the letter pairs in L. If a word can be formed, it prints "OK", otherwise it prints "KO". The code uses recursion and pattern matching to iterate through the letters in each word and check if they can be formed using the given pairs.
