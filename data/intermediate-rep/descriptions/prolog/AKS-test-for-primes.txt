This Prolog code defines a function prime_test_per_requirements(N) that uses the AKS test to determine whether a given number N is prime. The function first calculates the coefficients for N using the coefficients(N, [1|Coefficients]) function, then checks if each coefficient is divisible by N. This implementation is noted as inefficient for testing prime numbers, but it fulfills the requirements for the task.
