This code defines a predicate `minimum_abbreviation_length` that takes a list of day names and a minimum length as input. It then sorts the day names, calculates the minimum abbreviation length for each day name, and outputs the result in the format of minimum abbreviation length and the original day name. The code also includes functions to process a stream of day names from a file, convert the day names to uppercase, and handle the main execution of the program by processing a file named "days_of_week.txt".
