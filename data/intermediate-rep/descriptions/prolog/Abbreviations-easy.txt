This Prolog code defines a `command_table` of various commands and their variations. The `validate` predicate is used to check if a given word matches any of the commands in the table, accounting for case differences and command prefixes. The `main` predicate reads input arguments, validates them against the command table, and prints the corresponding validated commands to the console.
