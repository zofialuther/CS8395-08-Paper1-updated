This code defines a predicate `proper_divisors` that calculates the proper divisors of a given number. It then uses the `dpa` predicate to categorize the number as deficient, perfect, or abundant based on the sum of its proper divisors. The `dpa` predicate also measures the time it takes to perform these calculations and outputs the number of deficient, perfect, and abundant numbers, as well as the time taken to compute.
