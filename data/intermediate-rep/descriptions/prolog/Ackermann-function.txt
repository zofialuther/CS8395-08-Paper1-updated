This Prolog code defines the Ackermann function, which is a non-primitive recursive function that grows very quickly. The code uses Peano's first axiom to avoid explicit checks for N > 0 and arithmetic operations. The function is implemented using recursion and unification, but because Prolog clauses are relations and cannot be replaced by their result, an extra argument is needed to hold the output of the function. The code provides an example input/output of the Ackermann function.
