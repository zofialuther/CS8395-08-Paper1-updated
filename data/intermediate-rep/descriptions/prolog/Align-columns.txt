This code defines an "aligner" program that takes a text file with lines and fields separated by a dollar character and aligns each column of fields by ensuring that words in each column are separated by at least one space. It allows for each word in a column to be left justified, right justified, or center justified within its column. The code includes functions to parse the input text, compute the length of the longest word, and format the output with the desired justification. Finally, it includes a function to display the left, center, and right justified output.
