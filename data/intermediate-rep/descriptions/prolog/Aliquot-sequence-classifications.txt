This code defines predicates to calculate the divisor sum of a number and to determine the class of an aliquot sequence. The divisor_sum predicate calculates the sum of the divisors of a given number, while the aliquot_sequence predicate determines the class of an aliquot sequence (perfect, amicable, sociable, aspiring, cyclic, or non-terminating). The write_aliquot_sequence predicate is used to print out the results of the aliquot sequence calculation. The main predicate uses these predicates to calculate and print the aliquot sequence for a range of numbers and specific pre-defined numbers.
