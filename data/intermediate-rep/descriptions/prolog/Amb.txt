This code defines a simple Prolog program that demonstrates the use of the amb operator to generate all possible combinations of words from given lists. The amb predicate is used to non-deterministically select elements from a list, and the joins predicate is used to check if the last element of one list is the same as the first element of another list. The amb_example predicate uses amb to generate all possible combinations of words from predefined lists and checks if they can be joined together in a specific way.
