This code consists of several predicates for finding amicable pairs of numbers within a given range. The `divisor/2` predicate finds the divisors of a number, the `proper_divisor/2` predicate filters out the number itself as a divisor, and the `assoc_num_divsSum_in_range/3` predicate creates an association list of numbers and the sum of their proper divisors within a given range. The `get_amicable_pair/2` predicate retrieves pairs of amicable numbers from the association list, and the `amicable_pairs_under_20000/1` predicate uses these predicates to find all amicable pairs under 20000.
