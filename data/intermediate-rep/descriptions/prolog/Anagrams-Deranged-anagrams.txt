This code is designed to find the longest deranged anagrams within a given word list. It first retrieves a list of words from a specified URL and then sorts and groups the words based on their length. It then compares the length of the words and their keys to organize them in a specific order. The code then checks for derangement of anagrams and searches for the longest deranged anagrams among the grouped words. If it finds a deranged anagram, it prints the pair of words.
