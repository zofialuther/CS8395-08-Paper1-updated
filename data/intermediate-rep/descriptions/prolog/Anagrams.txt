This code retrieves a list of words from a URL, sorts them, and then groups them based on their lengths. The code then extracts the first 6 groups of words and converts their corresponding numeric codes into strings. Finally, it prints the resulting strings to the console. The code uses various predicates to achieve these operations, including reading the file, sorting the list of pairs, and comparing the lengths of the values.
