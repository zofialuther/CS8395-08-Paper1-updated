This Prolog code creates a simple pendulum animation using the PCE library. It defines a window with a line representing the string of the pendulum and a circle representing the pendulum bob. The animation is controlled by the `animation` class, which calculates the position of the bob based on the angle and length of the pendulum and updates it using a timer. When the animation is stopped or the window is closed, all resources are properly freed. The code also includes functions for calculating the position of the bob and determining the next angle of the pendulum swing.
