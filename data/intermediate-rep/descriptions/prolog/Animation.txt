This Prolog code is a simple animation program that creates a window displaying the text "Hello world ! " and animates it by continuously updating the displayed text. The animation is achieved by rotating the characters in the text either to the left or to the right. The program uses the PCE (Prolog Constraint Extension) library for creating graphical user interfaces. It defines a custom animation class and a click gesture class, and includes methods for initializing the animation, handling the animation timer, and processing click events. The `compute` predicate is used to determine the next text to be displayed based on the current animation direction and the text content. Overall, the code demonstrates how to create a simple animated graphical application in Prolog using the PCE library.
