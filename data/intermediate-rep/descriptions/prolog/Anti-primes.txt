The given Prolog code defines a predicate `divcount` that calculates the number of divisors for a given number `N`. It also defines a predicate `antiprimes` that finds the first N antiprimes, which are numbers with the most divisors compared to any smaller positive integer. The `main` predicate then uses `antiprimes` to find and display the first twenty antiprimes.
