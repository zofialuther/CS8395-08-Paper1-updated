The code defines a series of predicates to calculate and identify perfect numbers. It starts with a divisor predicate to find the divisors of a number, then uses a reciprocation and summation function to determine if a number is perfect. The main function then iterates through a range of numbers up to a specified limit and outputs the perfect numbers found.
