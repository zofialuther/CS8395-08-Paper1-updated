This code defines a simple calculator in Prolog. It starts with a lexer that tokenizes a string into a list of tokens, then a parser that constructs an expression tree from the tokens, and finally an evaluator that computes the value of the expression. The main predicate `calculator` takes a string representing an arithmetic expression, tokenizes it, parses it, evaluates it, and returns the result. An example use of the calculator is also provided.
