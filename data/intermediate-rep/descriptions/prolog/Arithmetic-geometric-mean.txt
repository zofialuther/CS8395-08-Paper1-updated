This code defines a predicate agm(A, G, Res) that calculates the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) of two numbers A and G. The AGM is calculated using a recursive algorithm, where if the absolute difference between A and G is less than 1.0e-15, the result is returned. Otherwise, the algorithm computes the next iteration of the AGM by taking the average of A and G and the square root of their product. The example query agm(1, 1/sqrt(2), Res) returns the AGM of 1 and 1/sqrt(2) as approximately 0.8472130847939792.
