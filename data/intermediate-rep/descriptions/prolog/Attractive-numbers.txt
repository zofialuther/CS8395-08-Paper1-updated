This code is a Prolog program that includes predicates to determine prime factors, check for prime numbers, and identify attractive numbers within a given range. The `prime_factors` predicate calculates the prime factors of a given number, while the `is_prime` predicate checks if a number is prime. The `attractive_number` predicate uses the prime factors to determine if a number is attractive, and the `print_attractive_numbers` predicate is used to print attractive numbers within a specified range. The `main` predicate calls the `print_attractive_numbers` predicate with a specified range to demonstrate its functionality.
