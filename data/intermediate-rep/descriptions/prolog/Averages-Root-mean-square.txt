This code calculates the root-mean-square of a list of numbers using Prolog. It defines a predicate `rms` that takes a list of numbers `Xs` and calculates the root-mean-square, and a predicate `sum_of_squares` to calculate the sum of squares of the numbers in the list. The `main` predicate generates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, calculates the root-mean-square using the `rms` predicate, and prints the result.
