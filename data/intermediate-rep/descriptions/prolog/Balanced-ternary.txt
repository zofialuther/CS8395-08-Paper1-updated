This Prolog code includes modules for efficient multiplication, division, and "euclidian" division. The efficient multiplication function uses strings as input to calculate the product of two numbers, considering positive and negative cases, while the efficient division function calculates the quotient and remainder of two numbers using positive numbers. The "euclidian" division function is less efficient but calculates the quotient and remainder of two numbers by performing addition and subtraction operations. The code also includes helper functions for negation and list manipulation. Overall, the code provides a comprehensive set of operations for working with numbers in Prolog.
