This Prolog code is an adaptation of an Ada example to generate an image of a Barnsley fern fractal. It uses random number generation and recursive iteration to plot the points of the fern. The `draw_fern` predicate creates the image in a PPM format file, which can be viewed using appropriate software. The code utilizes various Prolog libraries for handling lists, streams, and random number generation.
