This code defines a Prolog predicate to generate Bell numbers and create the Bell triangle. The bell/2 predicate calculates Bell numbers up to a given N and stores them in a list. The next_row/2 predicate generates the next row of the Bell triangle based on the previous row. The print_bell_numbers/2 and print_bell_rows/2 predicates are used to print out the Bell numbers and the rows of the Bell triangle, respectively. The main predicate demonstrates the usage of the bell/2 predicate to calculate and print the first 15 Bell numbers, the 50th Bell number, and the first 10 rows of the Bell triangle.
