This code is a Prolog program that examines whether the Fibonacci sequence follows Benford's law. The program includes a Fibonacci sequence generator, a function to calculate Benford's law, a function to retrieve the first characters of the first 1000 Fibonacci numbers, and functions to calculate the frequency of list items and output the results. The main goal of the program is to compare the frequency of the first characters of the Fibonacci numbers with the expected frequencies according to Benford's law. The results are then outputted in a readable format.
