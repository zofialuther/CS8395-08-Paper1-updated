This Prolog code is a program that calculates the best shuffle of a list of strings. It uses a combination of functions to shuffle the list, compare the original and shuffled strings, and calculate the minimum value based on the quantity of letters in the strings. The code also includes a function to sort and pack the list of letters. The program then outputs the best shuffle along with the original string and the score.
