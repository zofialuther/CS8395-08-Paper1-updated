The code defines a predicate binary(X) that takes an integer X and prints its binary representation using the format '~2r~n'. The main predicate then applies the binary predicate to a list of integers [5, 50, 9000] using the maplist function, and then halts the program. This code essentially converts the given integers to their binary representation and prints them to the console.
