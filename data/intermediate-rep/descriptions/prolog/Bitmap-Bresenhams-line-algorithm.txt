This Prolog code is used to draw a line on a bitmap image using recursive functions. The code begins by importing necessary modules and libraries. The `draw_recursive_line` predicate is defined to set the color of individual pixels in the bitmap, and recursively draw a line from one point to another. The `draw_line` predicate calculates the necessary parameters for the recursive drawing, such as the differences in x and y coordinates, and then calls the `draw_recursive_line` predicate to actually draw the line. Finally, the `init` predicate creates a new bitmap, draws a line on it, and then saves the resulting image as a .ppm file.
