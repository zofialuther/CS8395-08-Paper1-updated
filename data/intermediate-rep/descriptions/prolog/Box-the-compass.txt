This code defines a predicate `compassangle` that maps compass directions to their corresponding angles in degrees. It includes 32 compass directions, each with a unique index, name, heading abbreviation, and angle in degrees. The predicate also includes a rule to resolve the index based on a given angle, and a rule to calculate the index based on the angle. This code can be used to convert between compass directions and angles in degrees for navigation or mapping purposes.
