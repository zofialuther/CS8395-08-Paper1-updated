This Prolog code defines a guessing game engine that generates and evaluates guesses based on a set of constraints. The code uses constraint logic programming library (clpfd) to define the parameters and operations of the game. It includes functions for generating initial guesses, checking the correctness of guesses, and computing the numbers of digits in good and bad places. The code also uses dynamic memory to store previous guesses and their corresponding answers. Overall, the code represents the logic behind a guessing game where the goal is to deduce a sequence of digits based on feedback provided after each guess.
