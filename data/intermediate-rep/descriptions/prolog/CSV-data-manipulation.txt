This Prolog code defines a predicate called test that takes no arguments and calls the augment predicate with 'test.csv' as the input file and 'test.out.csv' as the output file. The augment predicate opens the output file, reads rows from the input file, processes each row to add a sum or 'SUM' at the end of the row, and writes the modified row to the output file. If the first item in a row is an integer, the sum of the row is calculated and appended; otherwise, 'SUM' is appended.
