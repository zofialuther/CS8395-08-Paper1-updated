This Prolog code is designed to generate a calendar for a given year. It uses various predicates to calculate the days of each month, the number of days in a month, the day of the week a month starts on, and whether or not it is a leap year. The main predicate 'write_calendar' takes a year as input and generates a formatted calendar for that year, with each month displayed in rows and columns. It uses various helper predicates to format and display the calendar data. The code also includes a predicate to test for leap years. Overall, the code aims to produce a visually appealing and accurate calendar representation for the specified year.
