This code defines two predicates for generating and indexing elements in the Calkin-Wilf sequence. The first predicate, g(N,X), consecutively generates the first N elements of the sequence in the list X. The second predicate, t(A/B,X), generates the index of the fraction A/B in the Calkin-Wilf sequence. The code uses recursion and mathematical operations to achieve these tasks. The comments indicate that the code was created by John Devou on 26-Nov-2021.
