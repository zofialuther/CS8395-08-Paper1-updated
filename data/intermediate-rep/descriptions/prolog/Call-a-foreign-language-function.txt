This code is a Prolog module called "plffi" which contains a predicate "strdup/2". It also uses a foreign library called "plffi" which likely contains foreign function interfaces for interacting with external libraries or languages. The "strdup/2" predicate is likely used to duplicate a string and takes two arguments. Overall, this code allows Prolog to interface with external functionality using foreign function interfaces.
