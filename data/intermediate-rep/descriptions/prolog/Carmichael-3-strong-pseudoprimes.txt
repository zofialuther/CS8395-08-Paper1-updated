This code is a Prolog program that includes predicates for generating and displaying Carmichael numbers. The `show` predicate takes a limit as input and uses the `carmichael` predicate to find the prime factors and the Carmichael number, then formats and displays the results. The `carmichael` predicate calculates a Carmichael number based on a given limit and certain conditions. The `wheel235` and `prime` predicates are used to check for prime numbers. Overall, this code is designed to generate and display Carmichael numbers and their prime factors within a specified limit.
