This code defines a predicate `catalan(N)` that calculates the first N Catalan numbers and prints them in the format "N : Value". It uses the `init/3` predicate to calculate the values of the Catalan numbers and the `my_write/2` predicate to print them. The `numlist/3` predicate is used to generate a list of numbers from 0 to N, and the `maplist/3` predicate is used to apply the `my_write/2` predicate to each pair of numbers and values.
