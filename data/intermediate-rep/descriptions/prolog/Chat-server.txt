This code is a Prolog implementation of a simple chat server. It sets up a TCP server on a specified port, accepts incoming connections, and handles communication between clients. Upon connection, it prompts the user to enter a username and then allows them to send and receive messages to and from other connected clients. The server also handles broadcasting messages to all connected clients except the sender. It uses dynamic predicates to keep track of connected users and their respective connections. Overall, the code provides the infrastructure for a basic chat server with user authentication and message broadcasting capabilities.
