This code implements the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which is used to find the solution to a system of congruences. It takes in two lists, A and N, and computes the value of X such that X is congruent to the elements of A modulo the elements of N. The code checks if the elements of N are prime, computes the product of the elements of N, generates the Mi and Ci lists, and then performs the necessary calculations to find the value of X. The code is written in Prolog and is based on the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, and Ronald Rivest. It is compiled with gprolog 1.4.5 (64 Bits).
