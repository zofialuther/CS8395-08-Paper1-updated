This code is a prolog program that determines the Chinese zodiac animal, element, and yin/yang symbol for a given year. It defines the animals, elements, animal and element characters, years, and several predicates to calculate the zodiac information based on the input year. The main predicate then iterates through a list of years and prints out the zodiac information for each year.
