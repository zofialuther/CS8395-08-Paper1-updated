The code defines predicates to calculate Chowla numbers, count prime numbers, and find perfect numbers within a given range. The `chowla` predicate calculates the Chowla number for a given input, the `prime_count` predicate counts the number of prime numbers within a range, and the `perfect_numbers` predicate finds perfect numbers within a range. The `main` predicate runs these calculations for various ranges and prints the results.
