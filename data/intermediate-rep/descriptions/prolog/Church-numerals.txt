This code defines various predicates for performing arithmetic operations using Church numerals, which represent natural numbers using a functional representation. The predicates include addition, multiplication, and exponentiation operations. The `int_church` predicate is used to convert integers to Church numerals, and the `run` predicate demonstrates the use of these operations by performing calculations and then converting the results back to integers for display.
