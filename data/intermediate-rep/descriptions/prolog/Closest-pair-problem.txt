This code is a function called "do_find_closest_points" that takes a list of points as input. The function is likely designed to find the closest points to each other within the given list, and potentially return or perform some action based on those closest points. The points are represented as (x, y) coordinates, and the function likely uses some form of distance calculation to determine the closest points.
