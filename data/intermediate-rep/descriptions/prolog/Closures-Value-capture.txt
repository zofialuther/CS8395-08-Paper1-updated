This code utilizes the lambda library module to create a closure function. The closure function generates a list of numbers from 1 to 10 and then creates a list of functions based on those numbers. The make_func predicate generates a function that squares its input, and the call_func predicate calls each function in the list and prints the result. The output will display the number and the result of the function when applied to that number.
