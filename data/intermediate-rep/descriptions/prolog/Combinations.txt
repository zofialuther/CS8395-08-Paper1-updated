This Prolog code defines a predicate comb_Prolog that takes a list L, a number M, and a number N as input. It uses the length predicate to ensure that the length of list L is equal to M, and then uses the fill predicate to populate the list with numbers starting from 1 up to N. The fill predicate uses recursion to iterate through the list and ensure that each element is within the range of 1 to N.
