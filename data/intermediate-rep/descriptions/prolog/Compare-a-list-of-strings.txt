This code defines a predicate "los" which takes a list of strings as input and checks if the elements in the list are lexically equal or in ascending order. It also defines predicates for checking if elements are lexically equal and in ascending order. The "test_list" predicate takes a list as input, checks if the elements are lexically equal and in ascending order, and prints the results. The "test" predicate runs the "test_list" predicate for all lists of strings defined by the "los" predicate.
