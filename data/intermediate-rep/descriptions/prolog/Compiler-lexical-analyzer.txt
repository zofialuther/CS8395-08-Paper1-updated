This code is a test harness for an analyzer that tokenizes input data. The `load_file` predicate reads a file and converts it to a list of characters, which is then passed to the `tester` predicate. The `tester` predicate tokenizes the input characters using a DCG (Definite Clause Grammar) and prints out the tokens. The `tokenize` predicate processes the input list of characters and extracts tokens, excluding spaces. The code also includes helper DCGs for handling more complex token types and defines various token types such as operators, symbols, keywords, identifiers, literals, and spaces. Additionally, the code handles exceptions such as unclosed comments and invalid identifiers.
