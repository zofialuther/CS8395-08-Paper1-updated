This code calculates continued fractions for three specific mathematical constants: the square root of 2, Napier's constant (e), and pi. It uses a recursive function to compute the continued fraction for each constant, and then formats and prints the results. The continued_fraction function takes a number of iterations N, a function to compute the A and B values for the continued fraction, and returns the final value V. The specific functions for the square root of 2, Napier's constant, and pi are also defined within the code. Overall, this code provides a framework for computing continued fractions for specific mathematical constants and displaying the results.
