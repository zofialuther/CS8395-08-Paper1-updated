This Prolog code uses the constraint logic programming library (clpfd) to perform time conversions. It defines a predicate to split a given time value into weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and then writes out the result in a special format. The main predicate can take either a single time value or a list of split values to calculate the time in each unit. It also includes helper predicates to perform the time split and specify the different time split types.
