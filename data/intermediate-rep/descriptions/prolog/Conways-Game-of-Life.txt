This Prolog code is for simulating the Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. The code generates a grid of cells and simulates their evolution over a set number of generations. The main procedure takes an input file path and generates a series of generations of life, storing each one as a file. The "cellular" predicate applies the Game of Life rule set to every cell in the grid. The code also includes predicates for reading a 2-bit Portable Bitmap (PBM) into a 2-dimensional list, nesting a simple list into a 2-dimensional list, and writing a 2-dimensional list back to a 2-bit PBM. Additionally, the code includes instructions for compiling and running the source file, creating a subfolder to store initial PBMs, and creating a GIF animation of the generations. The code also acknowledges Ren√© Thiemann for improving the runtime performance.
