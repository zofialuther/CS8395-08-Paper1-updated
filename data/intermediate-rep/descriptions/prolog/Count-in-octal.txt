This Prolog code defines predicates for working with octal numbers. The predicate o(O) checks if O is a member of the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. The predicate octal([O]) checks if O is an octal number, and the predicate octal([A|B]) recursively checks if the list [A|B] is an octal number by appending a digit T to the octal number O and ensuring that A is not equal to 0. The octalize predicate uses forall to iterate through all possible octal numbers and print them out in octal format.
