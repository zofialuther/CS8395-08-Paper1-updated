This Prolog code defines a predicate count_substring that takes in a string, a substring, and returns the total number of occurrences of the substring within the string. It does so by recursively counting the occurrences of the substring within the string and updating the count until the entire string is processed. The code also includes a helper predicate substring_rest, which extracts the remaining part of the string after the substring is found.
