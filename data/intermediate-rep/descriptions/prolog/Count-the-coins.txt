This Prolog code uses the Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (clpfd) library to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a total value of T cents. The coins predicate takes input for the number of quarters (Q), dimes (D), nickels (N), and pennies (P), and calculates the total value based on the number of each type of coin. The coins_for predicate then calls the coins predicate and uses the maplist predicate to iterate through all possible solutions and print out the valid combinations of coins.
