This code performs various matrix operations, including removing elements, rows, and columns, calculating cofactors, determinants, replacing elements, and solving systems of linear equations using Cramer's rule. The specific functions in the code include removing an element from a list, removing a column from a matrix, removing a row from a matrix, calculating the cofactor of a matrix, finding the determinant of a matrix, replacing an element in a list, replacing a column in a matrix, calculating Cramer's rule elements, and solving a system of linear equations using Cramer's rule. The "results" function defines a specific matrix A and vector B and then solves for X using Cramer's rule.
