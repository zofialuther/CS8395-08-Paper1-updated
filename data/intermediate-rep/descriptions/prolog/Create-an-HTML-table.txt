This code generates an HTML table with a header and rows. The header and rows data are defined in the `table` predicate. The `theader` predicate is used to generate the table header, and the `trows` and `trow` predicates are used to generate the table rows. The `table` predicate ultimately creates the HTML table using the defined header and rows data and prints it using the `print_html` predicate.
