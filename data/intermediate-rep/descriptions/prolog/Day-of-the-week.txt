This code is a Prolog program that generates a list of years in which Christmas falls on a Sunday between the years 2011 and 2121. It defines a main predicate that calls christmas_days_falling_on_sunday, which in turn creates a list of years within the specified range and filters those that have Christmas on a Sunday using the is_christmas_day_a_sunday predicate. The final list of years is then printed using the writeln predicate.
