This code defines a set of rules and a main function for assigning departments to police, fire, and sanitation services. The 'dept' rule assigns a number between 1 and 7 to a department. The 'police' rule assigns specific numbers to police departments, while the 'fire' and 'san' rules assign any department number to fire and sanitation services. The 'assign' rule ensures that the police, fire, and sanitation departments are different and adds up to 12. The 'main' function prints all possible combinations of department assignments to the console. When run, it will display the valid combinations of police, fire, and sanitation department assignments.
