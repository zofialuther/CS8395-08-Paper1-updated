This Prolog code sets the double quotes flag to 'chars' and defines a main predicate that calls the same_or_different predicate with different input strings. The same_or_different predicate formats the input string and then calls the examine predicate.

The examine predicate takes a list as input and checks if all the characters are the same. If they are, it prints a message saying all the characters are the same. If not, it prints a message indicating which character is different and at which index it occurs.

Overall, this code is designed to compare strings and identify if all the characters are the same or if there are any differences, providing informative output for each case.
