This code defines a Prolog predicate `report_duplicates/1` that takes a string `S` as input and reports any duplicate characters in the string. It first finds the duplicates using the `duplicates/2` predicate and then formats and reports the duplicate characters and their positions using the `report/1` predicate. If all characters are unique, it prints a message indicating so. The code also includes a test predicate `test/0` to demonstrate the functionality with different input strings.
