This Prolog code defines a predicate "collapse" that takes a string as input and returns a collapsed version of the string. The "collapse_" predicate recursively combines consecutive identical characters in a list into a single character, while the "collapse" predicate converts the input string into a list of characters, applies the "collapse_" predicate, and then converts the resulting list back into a string.
