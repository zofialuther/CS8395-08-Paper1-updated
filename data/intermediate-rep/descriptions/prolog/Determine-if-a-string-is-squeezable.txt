This code defines a predicate `squeeze/3` that takes a string `Str`, a character `SqueezeChar`, and returns the collapsed string `Collapsed`. The `squeeze/3` predicate converts the input string into a list of characters, and then applies the `squeeze_/3` predicate to collapse consecutive occurrences of the `SqueezeChar` into a single occurrence in the list. Finally, it converts the resulting list back into a string and returns it as the `Collapsed` result.
