This code defines predicates to calculate the digit sum and digital root of a number in a given base. The digit_sum predicate calculates the sum of the digits of a number in the given base, while the digital_root predicate calculates the digital root and additive persistence of the number. The test_digital_root predicate is used to test the digital_root predicate with different input numbers and bases. The main predicate runs a series of tests using the test_digital_root predicate.
