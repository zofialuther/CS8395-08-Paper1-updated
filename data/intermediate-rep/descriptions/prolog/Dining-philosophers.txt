This code simulates the classical problem of the dining philosophers. It creates a window to display the philosophers, forks, and statistics. The program models the behavior of the philosophers and a waiter who gives and takes back the forks necessary for eating. The philosophers go through the states of thinking, waiting, and eating, and statistics are collected for each philosopher's activities. The forks change position and status (free or used) during the simulation.
