This code is a Prolog program that calculates and displays dates in the Discordian calendar, a satirical system of time-keeping based on the Principia Discordia. The main function calls the test predicate for specific Gregorian dates. The test predicate then calls the ddate predicate to convert and format the dates into the Discordian calendar system. The ddate predicate handles the conversion and formatting of the dates based on the Discordian year, month, and day. The program also includes functions to convert years, calculate the day of the year, and define the seasons, weekdays, and holy days in the Discordian calendar.
