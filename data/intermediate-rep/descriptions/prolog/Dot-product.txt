This Prolog code defines a predicate dot_product that takes in two lists L1 and L2, and a number N. It uses the mult predicate to map over L1 and L2, multiplying corresponding elements and storing the results in a list P. Then, it uses the sumlist predicate to sum up the elements of P and unify the result with N. The mult predicate simply multiplies two numbers and unifies the result with a third variable.
