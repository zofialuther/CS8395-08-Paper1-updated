This Prolog code generates a visual representation of the Dragon Curve using a recursive algorithm. The dragonCurve(N) predicate takes an input N and uses it to compute the points and turns of the Dragon Curve. The dcg_computePath predicate calculates the list of points based on the input parameters, while dcg_dg computes the list of "turns" for the Dragon Curve. The code then creates a window to display the generated path and opens it for visualization.
