This code implements the Egyptian division method, which is a method of dividing two numbers using repeated subtraction and powers of 2. The egyptian_divide predicate takes a Dividend and Divisor as input and calculates the Quotient and Remainder using the powers2_multiples and accumulate predicates. The test_egyptian_divide predicate is used to test the egyptian_divide function with a specific set of input values. The main predicate calls test_egyptian_divide with the values 580 and 34, and prints the result.
