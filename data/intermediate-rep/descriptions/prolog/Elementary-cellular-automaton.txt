This code defines a simple cellular automaton that follows a set of rules to determine the state of each cell in the next generation. The `play` predicate initiates the automaton with an initial state and then runs the `do_auto` predicate for 50 iterations. The rules are defined in the `r` predicates, and the `apply_rules` predicate applies these rules to the current state to calculate the next state. The `writ` predicate is responsible for printing the current state of the automaton, with `.` representing a dead cell and `1` representing a live cell.
