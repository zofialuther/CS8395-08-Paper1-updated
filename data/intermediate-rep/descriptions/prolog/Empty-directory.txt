This code defines two predicates: non_empty_file/1 and empty_dir/1. The non_empty_file/1 predicate checks if a file is not empty, with the arguments '.' and '..' representing the current and parent directory. The empty_dir/1 predicate takes a directory as an argument and uses the directory_files/2 and maplist/2 predicates to check if the directory is empty by ensuring that all files within it are not empty.
