This code defines a module `shannon_entropy` that provides a predicate `shannon_entropy/2` for calculating the Shannon Entropy of a given string. The `shannon_entropy/2` predicate takes a string as input and returns the calculated Shannon Entropy as an output. The Shannon Entropy is calculated based on the relative frequencies of characters in the input string. The module also provides helper predicates for calculating relative frequencies, run-length encoding, logarithms, and summing numbers. The code includes examples of how to use the predicates to calculate the Shannon Entropy and relative frequencies for different input strings.
