This Prolog code defines a predicate "equilibrium_index" that takes a list and an index as input. It checks if there is an index in the list such that the sum of the elements before the index is equal to the sum of the elements after the index. If such an index exists, it is returned as the output. This is achieved by using the "append" predicate to split the list into two parts, calculating the sum of each part using "sumlist", and then comparing the sums to find the equilibrium index.
