This code is a Prolog program that generates and prints esthetic numbers in various number bases. Esthetic numbers are numbers in a given base where the digits are in non-decreasing order when written in that base. The main predicate runs a series of tests, printing esthetic numbers in different bases and within specified ranges. The program also includes predicates to calculate and print the esthetic numbers, as well as a function to find the next esthetic number in a given base.
