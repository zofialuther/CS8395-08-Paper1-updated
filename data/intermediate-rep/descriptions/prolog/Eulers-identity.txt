This Prolog code defines a predicate `reduce` that simplifies mathematical expressions and prints the intermediate results as Prolog processes the input. The `reduce` predicate calls the `simplify` predicate to simplify the input expression `A` and then checks if the result `B` is equal to the original input. If it is, the result `C` is set to `A`, otherwise, the intermediate result `B` is printed and the `reduce` predicate is called recursively with `B` as the new input. The `simplify` predicate defines rules for simplifying addition, multiplication, and trigonometric functions, as well as handling special cases such as 0, 1, and pi.
