The code defines a predicate makepowers which calculates the 5th power of numbers from 1 to 249 and stores them in a database using assert. It also defines a predicate within which is similar to between but with an exclusive upper bound. The solution predicate uses makepowers and within to find a solution where the sum of the 5th powers of four numbers (X0, X1, X2, X3) is equal to the 5th power of another number Y.
