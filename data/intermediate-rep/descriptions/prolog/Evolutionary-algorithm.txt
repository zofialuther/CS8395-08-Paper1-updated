This code is a Prolog implementation of the "Weasel Program," a thought experiment by Richard Dawkins to demonstrate how cumulative selection could lead to the evolution of complex structures. The program generates random text and then mutates it to match a target phrase, scoring each mutation based on the number of differences from the target. It then selects the best mutations and continues the process until the target phrase is reached. The "weasel" predicate is the main entry point for running the program with a specific target phrase, initial text, and mutation probability.
