This code is a Prolog program that utilizes the 'markov.pl' module and the lambda library. It defines a series of markov_1 to markov_5 predicates, each of which contains a set of rules and a string to which the rules are applied using the apply_markov function. The rules consist of string transformations based on specific patterns, and the resulting transformed strings are printed as output. This code demonstrates the use of the Markov Algorithm for text transformation and includes examples such as word substitutions, unary multiplication, and a Turing machine simulation.
