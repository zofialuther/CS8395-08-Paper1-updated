This Prolog code defines a predicate "fact" that calculates the factorial of a given number N. It uses a helper predicate "cont_fact" to perform the actual calculation. The "fact" predicate takes two arguments, N and FN, and uses "cont_fact" to find the factorial of N and bind it to FN. The "cont_fact" predicate uses a continuation-style programming approach to recursively calculate the factorial. If N is 0, it returns 1 as the factorial. Otherwise, it recursively multiplies N by the factorial of N-1 until N is 0.
