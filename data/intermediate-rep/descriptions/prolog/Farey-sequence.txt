This code defines two tasks that utilize the Farey sequence, a sequence of rational numbers. The first task generates and prints the Farey sequence for numbers 1-11, while the second task calculates the length of the Farey sequence for multiples of 100 from 1 to 1000. The code also includes a predicate to generate the Farey sequence and helper predicates for printing and comparing rational numbers.
