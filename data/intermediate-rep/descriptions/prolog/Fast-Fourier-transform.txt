The given code implements arithmetic operations for complex numbers and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm using Prolog. The arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and conversion from polar to rectangular form for complex numbers. The FFT implementation uses the twiddles/2 dynamic database predicate for efficient lookup of rational numbers and minimizes calls to the polar_cx/2 predicate. The fft/2 predicate recursively computes the FFT of a list of complex numbers. Finally, the test predicate demonstrates the usage of the FFT algorithm by applying it to a sample list of complex numbers and printing the results.
