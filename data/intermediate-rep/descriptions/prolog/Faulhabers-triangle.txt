This code defines a set of predicates for computing and displaying rows of Bernoulli numbers and calculating the sum of powers of natural numbers using the method of finite differences. The `ft_rows` predicate generates a lazy list of rows of Bernoulli numbers, while the `show` predicate displays a specified number of rows in a readable format. The `sum` predicate calculates the sum of powers of natural numbers, and the `horner` and `drop` predicates are used as helper functions for the main calculations.
