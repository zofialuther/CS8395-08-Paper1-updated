This Prolog code defines a predicate `directory_prefix` that finds the longest common prefix of a list of paths and a given stop value. It uses the predicates `longest_prefix` and `shortest_prefix` to find the longest common prefix, and the predicates `starts_with` and `ends_with` to check if a string starts or ends with a given substring. The code also includes error handling for empty input lists.
