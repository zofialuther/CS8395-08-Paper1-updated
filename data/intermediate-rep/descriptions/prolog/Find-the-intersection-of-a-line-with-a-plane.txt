The code is a Prolog program that defines operations for vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, and intersection calculation between a ray and a plane in 3D space. The main predicate initializes the values for the ray vector, ray point, plane normal, and plane point, and then calculates the intersection point of the ray with the plane. Finally, it formats and prints the coordinates of the intersection point.
