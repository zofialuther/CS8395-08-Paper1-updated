This code defines a Prolog program that determines which months in a range of years have five weekends (i.e., months that start on a Friday and have 31 days). It first calculates a list of all months with five weekends and another list of the remaining months. It then extracts the first and last five {year, month} pairs and finds the total number of years with no months containing five weekends. The program also includes helper predicates for working with lists and extracting year values from pairs.
