This code defines a Prolog predicate called fizzbuzz, which uses the forall predicate to iterate through numbers between 1 and 100 and call the print_item predicate for each number. The print_item predicate checks if the number is divisible by 3, 5, or both, and prints "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself accordingly. This code is a classic implementation of the FizzBuzz problem, which is commonly used as a simple programming exercise.
