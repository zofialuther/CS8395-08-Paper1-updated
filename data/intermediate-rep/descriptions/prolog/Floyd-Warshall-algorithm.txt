This Prolog code uses the clpfd library to find and print all paths between pairs of nodes in a graph. The `path` predicate finds a path between two nodes, while the `find_path` predicate finds all paths between two nodes that do not share the same value and have distinct elements. The `print_all_paths` predicate uses the `find_path` predicate to print the distance and path for all pairs of nodes in a given graph.
