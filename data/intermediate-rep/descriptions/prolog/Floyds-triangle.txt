This code implements the Floyd's Triangle pattern, where N is the number of rows in the triangle. It uses nested forall loops to iterate through each row and column, calculating and formatting the values to be printed in the triangle. The get_column predicate is used to retrieve the length of the number to properly format the output. Overall, the code generates and prints Floyd's Triangle with the specified number of rows.
