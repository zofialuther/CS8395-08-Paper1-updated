This code simulates a 4-bit binary adder chip using Prolog. It defines logic predicates for basic binary operations like NOT, AND, OR, and XOR, as well as half adder and full adder functions. The main b_4_bit_adder function takes two 4-bit binary numbers as input and computes their sum and carry. The test_add predicate is used to test the b_4_bit_adder function with different input values and display the results. The go predicate is then used to run the test cases and print the results. Overall, the code demonstrates the functionality of a 4-bit binary adder chip using logic programming in Prolog.
