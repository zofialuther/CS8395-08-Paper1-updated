This code creates a window to display a fractal tree. The drawTree predicate is used to draw the branches of the tree recursively, starting from a specified position and angle. Each branch is drawn at a decreasing depth, with the angle between branches changing to create a visually appealing fractal pattern. The size of the window is set to 800x600, and the tree is drawn with an initial depth of 9. Once the tree is drawn, the window is opened for display.
