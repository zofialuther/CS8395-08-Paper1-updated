This code defines a program called primegen that generates prime numbers using a specific algorithm. It includes functions to load the program with fractions, execute the program, capture the prime numbers generated, and perform other necessary calculations. The main function runs the primegen program, prints the first 15 steps, and then finds and prints the first 20 prime numbers generated by the program.
