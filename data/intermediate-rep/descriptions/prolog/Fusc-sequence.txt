This Prolog code defines a Fusc function that computes Fusc numbers, which are a sequence of integers. The code uses dynamic predicates for caching previous Fusc results to optimize performance. It also includes functions to print the first N Fusc numbers and to find and print Fusc numbers up to a given limit that are longer than any previous one. The main function calls these printing functions with specific parameters.
