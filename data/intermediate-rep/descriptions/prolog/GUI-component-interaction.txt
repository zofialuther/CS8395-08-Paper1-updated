This code defines a graphical user interface (GUI_Interaction) with a dialog window titled "Rosetta Code." The interface includes an input field, an increment button, and a random button. The input field has a label and a specified length. The layout of the interface is defined with specific areas for each component. The behavior of the interface includes functions for incrementing the input value, generating a random number, and handling input validation. Additionally, there is a predicate gui_component that creates and opens the dialog window. The increment and my_random predicates handle the functionality of the increment and random buttons, respectively. The input predicate handles input validation and focuses on the input field if the input is not a number. Overall, this code sets up a functional GUI with interactive components and behavior.
