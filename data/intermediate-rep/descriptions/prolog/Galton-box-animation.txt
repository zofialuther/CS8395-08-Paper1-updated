This Prolog code simulates a Galton Box, a device used to demonstrate the central limit theorem. The code creates a window for the Galton Box display and initializes pins, tubes, and balls. It also defines classes for pins, tubes, and balls, including their behavior and animation. The Galton Box simulates the random distribution of balls falling through a series of pins and into tubes, with the animation stopping when a tube is full. The code also includes functions for adding balls and displaying the pins and tubes in the Galton Box.
