This code defines a predicate gamma(X, Y) that computes the gamma function for a given input X. The implementation uses a Taylor series approximation for small values of X, and uses recursion to calculate the gamma function for larger values. The gamma_coefficients predicate stores the coefficients for the Taylor series approximation. The code also includes a tolerance value for early exit in the recip_gamma predicate.
