This Prolog code defines a predicate `a_to_z` which takes in two atoms `From` and `To`, and a list `L`. It uses the `atom_codes` predicate to convert the atoms `From` and `To` into lists of character codes `C_From` and `C_To`. Then, it uses the `between` predicate to generate a list `L1` of character codes between `C_From` and `C_To`. Finally, it uses the `maplist` predicate to convert the list of character codes `L1` into a list of atoms `L`.
