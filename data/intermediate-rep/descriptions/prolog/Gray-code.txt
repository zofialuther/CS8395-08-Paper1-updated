This code is a Prolog program that performs Gray code encoding and decoding. It defines predicates for converting a number to Gray code, converting Gray code back to the original number, and displaying the results. The `make_num` predicate converts input to an integer, and the `write_record` predicate formats the output. The `go` predicate generates a set of numbers from 0 to 31, then applies the encoding and decoding functions to each number, displaying the results in a tabular format. If successful, the program will terminate with a status code of 1.
