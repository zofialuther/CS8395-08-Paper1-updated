The code is a Prolog program that includes a set of predicates for working with Egyptian fractions. It includes functions for converting integers to atoms, calculating Egyptian fractions, finding the maximum terms and largest denominator for proper fractions, and displaying the results. The 'main' predicate serves as an entry point and demonstrates the usage of the other predicates by printing Egyptian fractions for specific numbers and showing the proper fractions with the most terms and largest denominator within a given limit.
