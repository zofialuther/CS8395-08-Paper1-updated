This code creates a simple number guessing game. The `pick_number` predicate prompts the user to choose a number between a specified minimum and maximum value. Once the user has chosen a number, the `guess_number` predicate uses a binary search algorithm to guess the chosen number. After each guess, the user provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too low, or too high. The game continues until the correct number is guessed. The `play` predicate orchestrates the entire game by calling the `pick_number` and `guess_number` predicates.
