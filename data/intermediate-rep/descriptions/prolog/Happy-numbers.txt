This code defines a predicate `happy_numbers` that generates a list of happy numbers. The code uses a recursive approach to find happy numbers by checking if a number is a happy number and then moving to the next number until the list is completed. The code also includes functions to check if a number is happy, get the next number, and process the list of digits. Overall, the code aims to generate a list of happy numbers based on the input length `Nb`.
