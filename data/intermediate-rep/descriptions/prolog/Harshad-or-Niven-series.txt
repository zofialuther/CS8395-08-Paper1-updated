This code is a Prolog program that uses the lambda library. It includes a predicate called niven, which sets a global variable to 1 and then generates and prints a sequence of Niven numbers. Niven numbers are numbers that are divisible by the sum of their digits. The program uses backtracking and global variables to generate and print the first 20 Niven numbers or until reaching a Niven number greater than 1000. The code also includes predicates for printing and generating Niven numbers, as well as calculating the sum of the digits of a number.
