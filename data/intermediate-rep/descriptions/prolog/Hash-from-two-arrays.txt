This code includes two implementations for creating a hash table from two lists. The first implementation uses side effects by using assert/1 to add elements to the hash table dynamically. The second implementation is a pure function that does not have any side effects. Both implementations take two lists as input and create a hash table using the elements from the first list as keys and the elements from the second list as values. The code also demonstrates how to use the pure implementation to create the hash table and then assert the elements of the hash table using findall/3.
