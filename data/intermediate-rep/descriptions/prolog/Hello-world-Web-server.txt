This code sets up a server using Prolog's HTTP libraries. It initializes the server to run on port 8080 and defines a handler for the root URI ("/") that returns a simple HTML page with the title "Howdy" and the content "Goodbye, World!" wrapped in <h1></h1> tags. The code uses various Prolog HTTP modules to achieve this functionality.
