This code uses Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) to compute the Hofstadter sequence. It defines constraints for the ffr and ffs functions to remove duplicates and then computes the values for ffr and ffs based on certain conditions. It initializes the sequence with ffr(1,1) and ffs(1,2) and then continues to compute the sequence using a loop until the desired value N is reached. The code also includes options to turn off debugging and optimize the CHR rules.
