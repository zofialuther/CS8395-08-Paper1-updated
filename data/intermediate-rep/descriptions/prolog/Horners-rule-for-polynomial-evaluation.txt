This code is a module that defines a predicate `horner/3` for evaluating the polynomial represented by a list of coefficients `L` at a given value `X`. It uses higher-order programming techniques and the `foldr` function from the `hiordlib` library to apply the Horner's method for efficient polynomial evaluation. The `horner/3` predicate takes the list of coefficients `L`, the value `X`, and returns the result of evaluating the polynomial at `X`.
