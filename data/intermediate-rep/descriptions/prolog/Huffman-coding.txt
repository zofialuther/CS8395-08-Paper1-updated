This code is an implementation of Huffman encoding, a method of lossless data compression. It first takes a string and converts it to a list of characters, then sorts and packs the list. It then builds a Huffman tree based on the packed list and generates the Huffman codes for each character. Finally, it prints the symbols, weights, and corresponding Huffman codes. The code consists of functions for building the tree, encoding the characters, and printing the codes.
