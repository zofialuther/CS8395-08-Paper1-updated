This code includes a predicate to rotate a list by a specified number of positions, as well as a predicate to rotate a list of lists by a list of integers. There is also a helper function for appending lists and a function to create an identity matrix using the rotation predicate. The main function demonstrates the use of the identity matrix function by printing the resulting matrix.
