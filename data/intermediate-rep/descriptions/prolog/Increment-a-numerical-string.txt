This Prolog code defines a predicate incr_numerical_string/2 that takes in two parameters, S1 and S2. The code first converts the input string S1 to an atom A1, and then converts the atom A1 to a numerical value N1. It then increments N1 by 1 to get N2, and converts N2 back to an atom A2. Finally, it converts A2 back to a string S2, which is the desired output. This code essentially takes a numerical string, increments its value by 1, and returns the new numerical string.
