This code uses the Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) library to define a constraint 'loop/1'. When the 'loop' constraint with a value N is triggered, it prints the value of N to the console, increments N by 1, and then triggers the 'loop' constraint with the incremented value. This creates a simple loop that continues indefinitely, printing each incremented value of N to the console.
