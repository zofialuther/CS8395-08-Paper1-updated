This Prolog code includes predicates to find a power of 4 greater than a given number, to calculate the integer square root of a number, and to display the integer square roots of numbers in a specified range. The main goal of the code is to demonstrate the functionality of integer square root calculation and to display the results for a range of input values, including powers of 7. The program uses recursion and conditional statements to achieve its objectives.
