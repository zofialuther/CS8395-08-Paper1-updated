This code includes predicates to read and manipulate JSON data in Prolog. It uses the `library(http/json)` and `library(func)` modules. The `test_json` predicate sets a sample JSON string as a fact. The `reading_JSON_term` predicate reads the JSON data into a Prolog dict, accesses a specific field, and alters another field. The `searalize_a_JSON_term` predicate creates a Prolog dict and serializes it into a JSON object. This code demonstrates how to work with JSON data in Prolog, including reading, accessing, and altering fields, as well as serializing Prolog dicts into JSON objects.
