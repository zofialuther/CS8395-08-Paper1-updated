This Prolog code defines a predicate `count_jewels` that takes three arguments: a string `Stones`, a string `Jewels`, and an integer `N`. The code first converts the input strings into lists of ASCII codes, sorts them, and then calls a helper predicate to count the number of occurrences of the jewels in the stones. The helper predicate iterates through the sorted lists and counts the number of occurrences of each jewel in the stones, finally returning the count in the `N` variable.
