This code defines a predicate kaprekar/2 which generates a list of numbers that satisfy the Kaprekar property. The Kaprekar property states that for a given number N, if the square of N can be split into two parts that add up to the original number, then N satisfies the Kaprekar property. The code also includes a helper predicate split_number/3 which splits a number into two parts and checks if they satisfy the Kaprekar property.
