This code is a Prolog program that takes a file as input and processes each line in the file. It first opens the file, reads each line, splits the line into parts, and checks if the magnitude (presumably of an earthquake) is greater than 6. If it is, it writes the line to the output. If the file argument is missing, it outputs an error message. The program uses the main predicate for initialization and control flow.
