This code implements a solution to the knapsack problem using constraint logic programming with finite domain constraints. It defines a list of items with their weights, values, and number of pieces, and then uses these values to find the optimal combination of items to fit into a knapsack with a weight limit. The code calculates the maximum total value that can be achieved and prints out the selected items along with their corresponding weights and values. It also includes a function to compute the length of the item names and a function to print out the results in a neatly formatted table.
