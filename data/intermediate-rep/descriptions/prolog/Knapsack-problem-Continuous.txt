This Prolog code implements a knapsack problem solution using the simplex algorithm. The knapsack problem involves selecting items to maximize their total value while not exceeding a certain weight limit. The code defines the items with their weights and values, creates constraints based on the weights, and maximizes the total value within the weight limit. It then computes the length of the item names and prints the results showing the selected items, their weights, and the total value achieved.
