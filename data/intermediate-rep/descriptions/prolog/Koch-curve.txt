This code is a Prolog program that generates a Koch snowflake and writes it to an SVG file. The main predicate calls the write_koch_snowflake predicate with the filename 'koch_snowflake.svg'. The write_koch_snowflake predicate opens a file stream, calls the koch_snowflake predicate to generate the snowflake, and then closes the stream. The koch_snowflake predicate writes the SVG header and background, then calls the koch_curve predicate to draw the Koch curve for each side of the snowflake. The koch_curve predicate is a recursive function that calculates the points for each iteration of the Koch curve. Overall, this code is used to create an SVG file of a Koch snowflake using Prolog.
