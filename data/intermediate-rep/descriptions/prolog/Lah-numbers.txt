This Prolog code calculates and prints unsigned Lah numbers using a recursive approach and caching to improve efficiency. It defines a predicate to calculate unsigned Lah numbers and another to print the numbers up to a specified limit. Additionally, it includes a predicate to find the maximum value of the unsigned Lah numbers for a given input. The main function demonstrates the use of these predicates by printing the unsigned Lah numbers up to L(12,12) and finding the maximum value of L(n,k) where n = 100.
