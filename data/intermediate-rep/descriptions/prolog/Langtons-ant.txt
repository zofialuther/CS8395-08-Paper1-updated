This code implements Langton's Ant, a cellular automaton with a simple set of rules. It creates a 500x500 window and plots black points within it based on the ant's movement. The ant moves in four directions (north, south, east, west) and changes the color of the point it's on based on whether the point is black or not. The 'go' predicate initiates the movement of the ant and updates the window to display the points.
