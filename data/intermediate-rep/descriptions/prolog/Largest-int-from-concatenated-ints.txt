This code defines a predicate `largest_int_v2` that takes a list of integers `In` and returns the largest possible integer formed by concatenating the digits of the numbers in the list. The code achieves this by converting the integers to lists of characters, sorting the characters in descending order, and then concatenating them back into a single integer. The sorting is done based on custom rules defined in the `my_sort` predicate, and includes specific cases for when the numbers have different lengths.
