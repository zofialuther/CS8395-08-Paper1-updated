This Prolog code defines a program for finding and manipulating lists of connected words. It includes predicates for initializing the list of words, checking if words are connected, computing lists of connected words, and extracting only the words from the connected lists. The program uses dynamic predicates to store and update the results. The main goal is to find lists of connected words and then extract only the words from those lists. The code uses lambda functions and dynamic predicates to achieve this. It also includes predicates for checking if words are connected based on their first and last letters. Overall, the code provides a comprehensive solution for working with lists of connected words in Prolog.
