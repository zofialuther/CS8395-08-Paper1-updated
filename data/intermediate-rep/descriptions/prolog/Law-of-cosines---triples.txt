This code is a Prolog program that finds solutions to the Pythagorean equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 within a specified limit. The main predicate `find_solutions` takes the limit and returns a list of solutions. The `is_solution` predicate checks if a, b, and c form a valid Pythagorean triple within the given limit. The `write_triples` predicate writes out the number of solutions and the corresponding Pythagorean triples for a specific angle. The `main` predicate demonstrates how to use the other predicates to find and output solutions for angles of 60, 90, and 120.
