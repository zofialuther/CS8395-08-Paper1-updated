This Prolog code takes a file as input and processes it to calculate the frequency of each alphabetic character. The file is read and converted to a list of character codes, which are then filtered to keep only alphabetic characters and converted to uppercase atoms. The list is then sorted and packed to count the consecutive occurrences of each character. The resulting frequency list is then printed with the number of occurrences for each character. The packList predicate is used to pack the sorted list into a list of sublists, each containing the character and its frequency. This code provides a way to analyze the frequency of alphabetic characters in a given file.
