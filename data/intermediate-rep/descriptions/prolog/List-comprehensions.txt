This Prolog code defines operators and predicates for list comprehension, allowing for the explicit usage of lists and the definition of intervals of numbers. It includes operators for binding variables, defining intervals, and creating list comprehensions with and without predicates. The code allows for the concise and flexible generation of lists based on variable assignments and conditions.
