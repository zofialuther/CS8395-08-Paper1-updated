The given code is a Prolog program that includes predicates to check for prime numbers, calculate divisors, and identify long prime numbers. The isPrime predicate checks if a given number is a prime number, the divisors predicate calculates the divisors of a given number, and the longPrime predicate identifies long prime numbers. The program also includes predicates to find long prime numbers within a specified range and to run the program with different limits to find long prime numbers. Finally, the do predicate is used to execute the program and display the long prime numbers up to a limit of 500.
