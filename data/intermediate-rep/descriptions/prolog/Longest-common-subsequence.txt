This Prolog code uses the time predicate to measure the performance of the lcs predicate, which calculates the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two given strings. The result of the LCS calculation is then printed using the writef predicate. The output shows that the calculation required 10,875,184 inferences and 1.840 CPU seconds to complete, and the resulting LCS is "beginning-iddle-ending".
