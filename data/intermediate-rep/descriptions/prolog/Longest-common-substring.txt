This code is a Prolog implementation of finding the longest common substring between two given strings. The common_sublist predicate is used to find all common substrings between two lists A and B, and the longest_list predicate is used to find the longest substring from a list of common substrings. The longest_substring predicate converts the input strings into lists of characters, finds all common substrings, and then selects the longest one to be the result.
