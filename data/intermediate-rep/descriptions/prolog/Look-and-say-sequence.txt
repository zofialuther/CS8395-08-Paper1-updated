This code contains a predicate `look_and_say` that takes a list `L`, displays it, encodes it using the `encode` predicate, and then repeatedly calls itself with the encoded list. The `encode` predicate uses the `packList` predicate, which utilizes the `clpfd` library to perform run-length encoding and decoding. The code also includes examples of how the `packList` predicate can be used to encode and decode lists.
