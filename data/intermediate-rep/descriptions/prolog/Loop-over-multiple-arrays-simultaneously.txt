This Prolog code defines a predicate called multiple_arrays, which takes three lists as input (L1, L2, and L3) and uses the maplist predicate to apply the display predicate to each corresponding element in the lists. The display predicate takes three arguments and uses the writef predicate to print the concatenation of the three arguments as a string. Overall, this code is used to display the elements of three lists in a formatted manner.
