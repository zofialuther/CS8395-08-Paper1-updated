This code defines a series of Prolog predicates for a simple loop. The "do" predicate is used to iterate through a series of values, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 each time. The loop is controlled by a condition that checks if the current value is divisible by 6, and if so, the loop fails. The "wloop" predicate is used to initiate the loop by calling the "do" predicate with an initial value of 0. As the loop iterates, it prints the current value and then increments it until the control condition is met.
