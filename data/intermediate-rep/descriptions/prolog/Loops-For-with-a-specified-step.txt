This code defines a predicate "for" that generates values in a descending order from a given high (Hi) to a low (Lo) using a given step size (Step). The first rule ensures that the step size is negative and the low value is less than or equal to the high value. The second rule calculates a new high value by subtracting the step size and then recursively calls the "for" predicate until the low value is reached, using the new high value as the starting point. The cut (!) operator is used to ensure that no further solutions are generated after the low value is reached.
