The code is a collection of predicates and functions related to generating and checking Mersenne prime numbers. It includes functions for finding Mersenne primes, generating Lucas-Lehmer sequences, and checking if a number is prime using the wheel factorization method. The `show` predicate finds Mersenne primes up to a given count and displays them, while the `mersenne_prime` predicate checks if a number is a Mersenne prime. The code also includes the `lucas_lehmer_seq` predicate for generating Lucas-Lehmer sequences and the `wheel235` and `prime` predicates for checking if a number is prime. Overall, the code provides a set of tools for working with Mersenne primes and prime numbers.
