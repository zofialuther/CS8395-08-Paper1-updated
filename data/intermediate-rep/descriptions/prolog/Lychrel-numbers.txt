This code defines a Prolog program to find and analyze Lychrel numbers. The main predicate lychrel/1 takes a single argument N and initiates the process of finding Lychrel numbers up to N. It uses helper predicates to reverse a given number, update a cache of results, and calculate Lychrel sequences. The program then outputs the number of seeds, the seeds themselves, the number of related numbers, and any palindromes found within the range. The main function main/0 initiates the program with a predefined value of 10000.
