This code uses the Prolog Constraint Extensions library to generate a graphical representation of the Mandelbrot set. It creates a window and an image to display the set, then iterates through each pixel to calculate the RGB values based on the Mandelbrot algorithm. The algorithm is implemented using recursive predicates to compute the RGB color values for each pixel. Finally, it opens the window to display the generated image.
