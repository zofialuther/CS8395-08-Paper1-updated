This Prolog code contains predicates for performing matrix multiplication and calculating the dot product of two vectors. It utilizes the clpfd library for the transpose operation. The dot/3 predicate takes two vectors and calculates their dot product, while the mmult/3 predicate performs matrix multiplication on lists of lists representing matrices M1 and M2 to produce the resulting matrix M3. The code also includes helper predicates for performing element-wise product and sum operations.
