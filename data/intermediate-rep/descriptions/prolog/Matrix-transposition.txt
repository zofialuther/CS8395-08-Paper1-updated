This Prolog code is a program that performs the transposition of a rectangular matrix. The code takes a matrix as input and produces the transposed matrix as output. It utilizes difference lists to efficiently perform append operations. The program uses recursion to transpose the matrix and uses maplist to apply functions to each element of the input matrix. The resulting transposed matrix is returned as the output.
