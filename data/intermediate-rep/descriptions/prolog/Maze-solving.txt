This is a Prolog code that is designed to solve a maze problem. The code utilizes dynamic predicates to store information about the maze, cells, and paths. The `maze_solve` predicate is used to initialize the maze and solve it. It creates a window to display the maze and uses random cell selection and backtracking to find a valid path through the maze. The `walk` predicate is used to recursively traverse the maze by retracting and asserting the path. The `display_path` predicate is responsible for displaying the path in the maze window. The `search` predicate is used to search for a valid path through the maze using random cell selection and backtracking. The code also includes helper predicates such as `erase_line` and `nextcell` to handle the visualization and maze traversal logic.
