The given Prolog code defines a predicate `rosetta_menu/2` which takes a list of items and a selected item as input. The code allows the user to select an item from the list by displaying a menu of items and prompting the user to input the number corresponding to the desired item. The code ensures that the selected item is a valid choice from the menu and returns it. If the list is empty, it simply returns an empty string. The code uses IO operations to display the menu and prompt the user for input, and it also includes checks to ensure that the user's input is a valid number and corresponds to an item in the list.
