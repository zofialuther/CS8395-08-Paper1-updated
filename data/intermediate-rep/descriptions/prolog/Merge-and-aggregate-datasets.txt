This code is a Prolog program that imports predicates from various modules and performs data processing tasks on CSV files. It includes functions for handling date and numerical data, as well as calculating summary statistics for visit and patient data. The program also includes a test predicate to demonstrate the functionality of the summaryDates and summaryScores predicates. Additionally, it defines hilog declarations for maximum, sum, and successor predicates.
