This code defines and calculates the Mertens numbers, which are related to prime numbers and the Riemann zeta function. It uses dynamic predicates to cache the calculated values for efficiency. The code includes a function to print the first 199 Mertens numbers and another to count the number of times the Mertens function crosses zero and the number of times it equals zero within a certain range. The main function calls these functions and displays the results.
