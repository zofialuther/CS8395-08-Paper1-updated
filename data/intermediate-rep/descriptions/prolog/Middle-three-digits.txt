This code defines a predicate `middle_3_digits` that takes a `Number` and a list `[D1, D2, D3]` as input and checks if the middle three digits of the absolute value of `Number` match the list. It first calls the `verify_middle_3_able` predicate to ensure that the input `Number` is a valid number with at least 3 digits and an odd number of digits. Then it uses the `append` and `same_length` predicates to check if the middle three digits of `Number` match the provided list.
