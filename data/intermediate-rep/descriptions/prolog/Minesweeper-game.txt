This Prolog code allows the user to play the game of Minesweeper. The user can specify the width and height of the game board and then play by exposing cells or marking bombs. The game will continue until the user either wins by exposing all non-bomb cells or loses by hitting a bomb. The code handles the generation of the grid, printing the grid, checking win and lose conditions, and performing operations on the grid based on user input. The game logic is implemented using Prolog's Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLPFD) library.
