This code is a Prolog program that calculates the minimum multiple of a number N that has the same digit sum as N. The main predicate generates numbers between 1 and 40, calculates their minimum multiple with the same digit sum, and then prints the result. The min_mult_dsum predicate is used to find the minimum multiple with the same digit sum, while the digit_sum predicate calculates the sum of the digits of a number. The program uses recursion to iterate through the numbers and find the minimum multiple with the same digit sum.
