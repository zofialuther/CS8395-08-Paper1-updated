This code defines a predicate 'congruence' that takes a congruence value, a list of input values, a function, and an output list as input. The predicate applies the congruence operation to the input list, then applies the given function to the modified input list to produce an output list. The 'fun_1' and 'fun_2' predicates are examples of functions that can be used with the 'congruence' predicate.
