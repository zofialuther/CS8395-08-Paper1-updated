The given code implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of a number. The egcd predicate calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers and also finds the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, while the modinv predicate uses the egcd result to find the modular inverse of a number A with respect to modulo B. This code is useful for cryptography and number theory applications.
