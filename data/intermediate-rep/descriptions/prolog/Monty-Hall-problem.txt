This code simulates the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle. The `play` predicate simulates a game where a contestant chooses a door, a prize is randomly placed behind a door, and a reveal door is selected. The `win_count` predicate runs the game multiple times and counts the number of wins when the contestant switches doors versus when they stay with their original choice. The `main` predicate runs the simulation 1000 times for both switching and staying and outputs the results.
