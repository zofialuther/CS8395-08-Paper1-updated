This code generates a table of numbers from S to E. It first prints a header with the numbers from S to E, then creates rows for each number from S to E, multiplying each pair of numbers to fill in the table. The numbers are formatted to align neatly in the table. If the table creation fails, it stops and moves on to the next clause.
