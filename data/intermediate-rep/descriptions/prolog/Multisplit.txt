This code defines a DCG (Definite Clause Grammar) rule called multisplit, which takes a list of separators and a token as input and splits the token into smaller tokens based on the given separators. The code uses the next_sep predicate to find and split the token at the nearest, longest separator. The multisplit rule recursively calls itself to split the remaining token until no more separators are found. The my_sort predicate is used to sort the list of separators to ensure the longest separator is found first. This code essentially provides a way to split a token using multiple separators in a specific order.
