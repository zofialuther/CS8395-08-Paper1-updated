This code defines the predicates female and male, which determine the number of females and males in a population based on the total number of individuals. The female predicate states that there is 1 female when the total number is 0, and otherwise calculates the number of females by recursively subtracting 1 from the total and finding the difference between the total and the number of males. The male predicate follows a similar logic, stating that there are 0 males when the total number is 0, and otherwise calculates the number of males by recursively subtracting 1 from the total and finding the difference between the total and the number of females. This code can be used to determine the distribution of females and males in a population.
