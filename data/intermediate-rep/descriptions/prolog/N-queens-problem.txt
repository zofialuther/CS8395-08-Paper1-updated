This code defines a solution predicate to solve the Eight Queens Puzzle. The solution predicate takes a list of X/Y coordinates representing the positions of queens on a chessboard and checks if they satisfy the constraints of the puzzle. The constraints ensure that no two queens can attack each other. The code uses recursion to iterate through the list of coordinates and check for attacks between queens. The member predicate is used to check if a given Y value is within the range of 1 to 8. Finally, the template predicate generates a template of valid Y values for each X coordinate to be used as input for the solution predicate.
