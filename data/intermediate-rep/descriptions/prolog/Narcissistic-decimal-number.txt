This code defines a predicate `armstrong` that finds all Armstrong numbers (numbers that are equal to the sum of their own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits) for a specified exponent. The code uses helper predicates `digits`, `combi`, and `powSum` to perform the necessary calculations and combinations. The `do` predicate iterates through exponents from 1 to 7 and prints the list of Armstrong numbers for each exponent.
