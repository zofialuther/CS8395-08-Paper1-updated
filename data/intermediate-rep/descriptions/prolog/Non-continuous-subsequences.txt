This Prolog code defines a predicate `ncsubs` that generates all the non-contiguous subsequences of a given list. It uses the predicates `one_ncsubs` to build one subsequence and `extract_elem` to extract one element of the list that is neither the first nor the last. The `sublist` predicate is used to extract the first or last element of the list. The code utilizes recursion and set operations to achieve its goal.
