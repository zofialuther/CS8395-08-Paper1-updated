This Prolog code is a nonogram/paint-by-numbers solver that uses the CLP(FD) constraint library. It includes functions for creating a grid, solving the nonogram puzzle, and printing the solved grid. The code defines constraints for rows and columns based on the given specifications, and uses finite-state constraints to determine the placement of blocks in the grid. The nonogram/ paint-by-numbers puzzle is solved using the specified row and column specifications, and the final solution grid is printed.
