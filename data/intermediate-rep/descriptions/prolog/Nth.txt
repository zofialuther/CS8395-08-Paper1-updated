This code defines a predicate nth/2 that takes an integer N and generates the Nth ordinal number as a string in the format "1st", "2nd", "3rd", etc. It also defines a helper predicate tween/1 to check for special cases where the ordinal suffix is "th". Additionally, there is a test predicate that demonstrates the use of nth/2 by printing out the ordinal numbers for a range of integers.
