This code implements a one-dimensional cellular automata using a set of rules to compute the next state of a given list. The automata continues to generate the next state of the list until it reaches a quiescent state. The rules for generating the next state are defined in the `compute_next` predicate. The `my_write` predicate is used for outputting a visual representation of the list. The main `one_dimensional_cellular_automata` predicate initializes the list and recursively calls itself to generate the next states until quiescence is reached.
