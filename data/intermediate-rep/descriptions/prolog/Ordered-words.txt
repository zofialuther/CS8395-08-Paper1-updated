This code uses the HTTP library to open a URL and read a list of words from it. It then processes and sorts the words based on their length and outputs the sorted list. The code also includes a predicate for sorting a list of pairs where the length of the values is compared first, and if they are the same, the keys are sorted in alphabetical order. Finally, it includes a predicate to write the sorted list of words.
