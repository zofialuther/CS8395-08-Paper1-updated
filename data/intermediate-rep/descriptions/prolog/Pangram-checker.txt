The code defines a predicate "pangram" which takes a list L as input and checks if it contains all the letters from 'a' to 'z'. The predicate uses the numlist predicate to generate the alphabet and then uses a forall loop to check if each letter is a member of the input list.

The pangram_example predicate demonstrates the use of the pangram predicate by checking two example strings L1 and L2. It then prints the input string along with the result of the pangram predicate check using the format predicate.
