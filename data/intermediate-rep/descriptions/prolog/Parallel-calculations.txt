This code defines a predicate `threaded_decomp` that creates a new thread to decompose a number into its prime factors. Another predicate `threaded_decomp_list` applies `threaded_decomp` to a list of numbers and then combines the results to find the number with the largest minimal factor. The `pack_exit_out` predicate extracts the result from the thread, and `largest_min_factor` finds the number with the largest minimal factor. Finally, the `format_it` predicate formats and prints the result.
