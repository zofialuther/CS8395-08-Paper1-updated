This code implements a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator in Prolog. It takes a list of tokens as input and processes them to perform arithmetic operations. The code includes a parsing function that skips spaces, detects operators and numbers, and computes the final result. It also defines the operations for multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and exponentiation. The output includes a log of the actions taken and the final value computed.
