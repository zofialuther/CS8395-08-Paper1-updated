This SWI-Prolog code defines a tabled predicate `p/2` that calculates a value `X` based on input `N`. The calculation involves two aggregate operations that sum values generated from a series of calculations using the `between` predicate. The code also includes a cut to optimize performance. The query `p(6666,X)` is timed and returns the result `X = 193655306161707661080005073394486091998480950338405932486880600467114423441282418165863`. The code demonstrates efficient calculation using tabled predicates in Prolog.
