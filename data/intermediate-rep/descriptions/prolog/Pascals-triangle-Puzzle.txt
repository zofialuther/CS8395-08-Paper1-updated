This Prolog code defines a puzzle predicate that takes a list of variables Ts and three additional variables X, Y, and Z. The puzzle involves arranging the variables in a triangular pattern such that Y is equal to the sum of X and Z. The code also includes predicates for defining triangles and solving the puzzle using constraint logic programming. When the puzzle predicate is called with anonymous variables for Ts and specific values for X, Y, and Z, it will find a solution that satisfies the constraints. In the example given at the end of the code, calling the puzzle predicate with anonymous variables results in X being assigned the value 5, Y being assigned the value 13, and Z being assigned the value 8.
