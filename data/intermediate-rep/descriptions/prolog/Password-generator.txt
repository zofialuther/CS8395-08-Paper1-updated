This Prolog code is a password generator that takes command-line options to specify the length and number of passwords to create. It uses a set of characters to generate random passwords, ensuring that each password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character. The generated passwords are then printed to the console. The code also includes a help option to display usage information.
