This code is a Prolog implementation of various mathematical functions. It includes functions to find the square root as a continued fraction, evaluate an infinite continued fraction as a lazy list of convergents, and solve Pell's equation. The code uses recursive functions to compute the continued fraction of a square root, calculate convergents, and solve Pell's equation for a given input. The code demonstrates the use of lazy lists, pattern matching, and integer arithmetic to perform mathematical operations.
