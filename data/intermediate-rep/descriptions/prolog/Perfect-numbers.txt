The code defines a Prolog predicate to find the divisors of a number and identify perfect numbers within a given range. The tt_divisors predicate calculates the sum of divisors for a given number. The perfect predicate uses tt_divisors to determine if a number is perfect. The perfect_numbers predicate generates a list of perfect numbers within a specified range.
