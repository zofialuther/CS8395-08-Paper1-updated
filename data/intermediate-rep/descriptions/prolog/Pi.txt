This code is a Prolog implementation of a pi spigot algorithm, which is a method for calculating the digits of the mathematical constant pi. The main predicate, pi_spigot, takes no arguments and calls the pi predicate to generate the digits of pi and then prints them out using Prolog's "forall" predicate. The pi predicate is defined recursively, using freeze to delay the computation until the output is needed. The pi predicate calculates the next digit of pi and then recursively calls itself to continue generating the digits.
