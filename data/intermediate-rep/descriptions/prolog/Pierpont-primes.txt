This Prolog code defines a program to generate the first 50 values of two sequences: "first_kind" and "second_kind." The sequences are based on a set of numbers known as "3-smooth" numbers, which are numbers that have no prime factors greater than 3. The code uses a heap data structure to efficiently generate the 3-smooth numbers and then uses them to calculate the values of the two sequences. Additionally, the code includes a primality checker using the Miller Rabin primality test and a round of trial divisions. Finally, the code outputs the first 50 values of each sequence and checks the 250th value of each sequence using the "show" predicate.
