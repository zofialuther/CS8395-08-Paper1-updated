This code is a Prolog program for evaluating poker hands. It defines various predicates for determining the best hand from a set of cards. The `best_hand` predicate takes a list of cards and returns the best hand possible, such as straight flush, full house, flush, etc. It also includes utility predicates for parsing input and running tests. The `main` predicate runs a series of tests to demonstrate the functionality of the program.
