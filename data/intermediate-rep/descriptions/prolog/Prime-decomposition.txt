This code defines a predicate `wheel2357` that generates a list `L` based on a predefined sequence `W`. It also defines a predicate `factor` that calculates the prime factorization of a given number using the wheel factorization method, and it includes helper predicates to perform the factorization process. The code uses recursion and pattern matching to efficiently calculate the prime factors and their exponents.
