This code demonstrates the usage of a priority queue in Prolog. It starts by creating a priority queue from a list of tasks and their priorities. Then, it adds additional tasks to the queue and displays the content of the queue. After that, it retrieves the task with the highest priority from the queue and displays it. Finally, it shows the updated content of the queue after the retrieval. This code provides a clear example of how to manipulate a priority queue in Prolog.
