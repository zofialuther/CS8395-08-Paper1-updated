The first code shows the proper divisors of each number in the range from 1 to 10. For example, the proper divisors of 4 are 1 and 2. The output shows the number and its corresponding proper divisors in a list format.

The second code finds the number within the range from 1 to 20000 that has the highest number of proper divisors. In this case, the number 15120 has 79 proper divisors, which is the highest within the given range. The output displays the number and its corresponding count of proper divisors.
