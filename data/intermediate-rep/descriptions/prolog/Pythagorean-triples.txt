This code is a Prolog program that generates Pythagorean triples and counts the number of primitive and total triples up to a specified maximum value. It includes predicates for finding Pythagorean triples, counting them, and generating triples within a given range. It uses a combination of list manipulation, arithmetic operations, and iteration to achieve this. The `show` predicate uses the `count_triples` predicate to count the number of Pythagorean triples and outputs the results in a formatted manner. The `triple` predicate generates Pythagorean triples using a combination of mathematical operations and iteration.
