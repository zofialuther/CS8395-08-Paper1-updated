This Prolog code defines predicates for manipulating a queue implemented as a difference list. The `empty` predicate checks if a queue is empty by unifying two variables with occurs check. The `push` predicate adds a value to the end of the queue using difference list notation. The `pop` predicate removes the first element from the queue and returns the updated queue. The `append_dl` predicate is used to concatenate two difference lists.
