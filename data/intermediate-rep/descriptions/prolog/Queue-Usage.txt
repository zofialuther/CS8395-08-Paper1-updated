This code defines a queue data structure using difference lists in Prolog. It includes predicates for creating an empty queue, pushing elements onto the queue, and popping elements from the queue. The code also demonstrates the use of the queue by creating an empty queue, adding numbers 1 and 2 to the queue, popping an element, and testing the queue for emptiness. Finally, it demonstrates popping the remaining elements from the queue.
