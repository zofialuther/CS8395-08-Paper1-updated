This Prolog code defines a predicate range_expand that takes a list of ranges as input and expands them into individual numbers. The code uses predicates to extract, study, and pack the ranges, and utilizes the clpfd library for constraint logic programming over finite domains. The extract_Range predicate separates the input list into individual ranges, study_Range validates and expands each range, and pack_Range combines adjacent numbers into ranges. Finally, the code outputs the expanded list of ranges.
