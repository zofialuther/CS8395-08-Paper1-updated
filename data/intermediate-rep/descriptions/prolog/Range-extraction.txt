This Prolog code defines a predicate `range_extract` that takes a list `L` as input and performs a series of operations to extract and manipulate ranges within the list. The code includes predicates for extracting ranges from a list, studying ranges to determine their start and end points, and packing ranges into a specific format. The code also utilizes the `clpfd` library for constraint logic programming over finite domains. Overall, the code is designed to process and manipulate ranges within a list in Prolog.
