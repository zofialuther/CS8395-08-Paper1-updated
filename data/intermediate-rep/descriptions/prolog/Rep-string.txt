This code uses the functional programming library to implement the logic for testing and identifying repeated substrings within a given string. The `test_for_repstring` predicate takes a string as input and returns a tuple containing the original string, a result indicating if there are any repeated substrings, and a list of the repeated substrings. The `repstring` predicate checks for repeated substrings within the given string. The `test_strings` predicate demonstrates the functionality with a list of example strings. The `report_repstring` predicate formats and prints the results of the test_for_repstring predicate. Finally, the `report_repstrings` predicate applies the test_for_repstring predicate to each string in the test_strings list and reports the results.
