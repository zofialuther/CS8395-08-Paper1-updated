This code is for a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game played against the computer. The 'play' predicate initiates the game by finding all previous moves, then calling the 'play' predicate with the list of previous moves. The 'play' predicate prompts the user to input their choice, then randomly selects the computer's choice from the list of previous moves. It then determines the result of the game (win, lose, or draw) and recursively calls itself with the updated list of previous moves. The 'beats' predicate defines the rules of the game, determining which choice beats another.
