This code defines a set of rules for decoding Roman numerals into their decimal equivalent. It uses a series of predicates to decode individual Roman numeral digits and then strings of Roman numerals. The main predicate, `decode_string/2`, takes an input string of Roman numerals and returns the corresponding decimal value. The code also includes a test predicate to verify the accuracy of the decoding process.
