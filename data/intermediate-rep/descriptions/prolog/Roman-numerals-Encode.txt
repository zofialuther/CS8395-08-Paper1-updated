This Prolog code defines a predicate `roman/0` and `roman/2` to convert Arabic numbers to Roman numerals and vice versa. It uses Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLPFD) to perform these conversions. The code also includes a DCG (Definite Clause Grammar) for parsing Roman numerals and a `my_print/2` predicate for printing the result of the conversion. The `roman/2` predicate takes an Arabic number and a variable and returns the Roman numeral for that number. The DCG provides rules for parsing Roman numerals into their constituent characters. Finally, the `my_print/2` predicate formats and prints the Arabic number and its Roman numeral equivalent.
