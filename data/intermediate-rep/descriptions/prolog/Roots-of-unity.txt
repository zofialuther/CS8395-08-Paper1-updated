This code is a Prolog predicate that calculates the roots of a given number N and stores them in a list Rs. It first generates a list Ks from 0 to the predecessor of N, and then uses the maplist predicate to apply the root(N) function to each element of Ks, resulting in the roots being stored in Rs. The root(N) function calculates the roots using complex numbers and trigonometric functions, adjusting for principal values as necessary. The cis predicate is used to calculate the complex exponential form of the roots.
