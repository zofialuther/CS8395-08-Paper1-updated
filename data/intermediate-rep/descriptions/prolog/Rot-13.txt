This Prolog code uses the library `ctypes` to implement the ROT13 encryption algorithm. The `runtime_entry` predicate sets up the program to prompt for user input and then call the `rot13` predicate. The `rot13` predicate reads input characters, applies the ROT13 transformation, and outputs the result. The `rot13_char` predicate handles the individual character transformation based on whether the character is alphabetic or not.
