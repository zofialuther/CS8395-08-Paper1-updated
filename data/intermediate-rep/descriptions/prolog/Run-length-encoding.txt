This Prolog code defines a run-length encoding and decoding system. The `encode` predicate takes a list of characters and encodes it into a compressed format, while the `decode` predicate reverses the process, decoding the compressed format back into the original list. The code also includes a `packList` predicate that packs repeated elements into sublists, and a `run` predicate that counts consecutive occurrences of an element. The use of the clpfd library ensures that the `packList` predicate works bidirectionally. Additionally, the code includes example queries demonstrating the functionality of the `packList` predicate.
