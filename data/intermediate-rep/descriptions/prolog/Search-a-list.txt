This Prolog code defines a predicate search_a_list/2 that takes two arguments N1 and N2 and performs a search operation on a predefined list L. The list L contains a set of names. The code first prints the entire list, then checks if N1 and N2 are present in the list and if yes, at which position. It also finds the last position of N1 in the list using the reverse_nth1 predicate. The my_write predicate is used to format and print the list of names.
