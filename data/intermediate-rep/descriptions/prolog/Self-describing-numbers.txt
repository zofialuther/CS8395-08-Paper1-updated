This code is a Prolog program that searches for self-describing numbers. A self-describing number is a number that describes itself, where the number of times each digit appears in the number is equal to the value of the digit. The program uses constraint logic programming to define and search for self-describing numbers. It includes predicates for verifying self-describing numbers, packing lists of numbers, and testing numbers for self-describing properties. The code also includes examples of how to use the `packList` predicate to pack and unpack lists of numbers.
