This code defines a set of predicates for generating prime numbers excluding multiples of 2, 3, and 5. It uses a wheel sieve algorithm to efficiently generate prime numbers and includes predicates for generating the wheel, checking if a number is prime based on the wheel, and finding all prime numbers up to a specified limit. The code also includes an accumulator predicate for the lazy list implementation.
