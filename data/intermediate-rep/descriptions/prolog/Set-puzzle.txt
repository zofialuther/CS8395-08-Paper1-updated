This code defines a Prolog predicate `do_it` that takes an integer `N`, generates a set of playing cards and their sets, and prints them in a formatted manner. The `card_sets` predicate calculates all possible sets of cards for a given number `N`. It uses the `random_deal` predicate to generate a random deal of cards and the `is_card_set` predicate to determine if a set of cards is a valid "set" according to certain rules. The program also includes predicates for random card generation and matching card attributes. Additionally, it has predefined values of `N` as 9 and 12.
