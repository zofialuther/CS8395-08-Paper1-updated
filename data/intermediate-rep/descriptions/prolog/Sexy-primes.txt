This module contains predicates to find and store prime numbers up to a given limit. The `find_prime_numbers/1` predicate takes a limit `N` and uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find and store all prime numbers up to `N` in the dynamic `is_prime/1` predicate. The `is_prime/1` predicate is used to check if a given number is prime. The module utilizes recursive predicates `init_sieve/2` and `sieve/2` to initialize the sieve and perform the sieving process, and `cross_out/3` is used to eliminate non-prime numbers from the sieve.
