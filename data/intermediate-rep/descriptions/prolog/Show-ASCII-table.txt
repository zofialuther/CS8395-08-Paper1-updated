This Prolog code defines a predicate 'ascii' which generates a table of ASCII characters and their corresponding codes. It uses the 'forall' and 'between' predicates to iterate over a range of ASCII codes, and then calls the 'row' predicate to format and print each row of the table. The 'row' predicate handles the formatting of each row, while the 'code' and 'ascii' predicates handle the formatting of individual codes and characters. The output is a neatly formatted table showing the ASCII characters and their corresponding codes.
