This code generates a Sierpinski carpet fractal and writes it to an SVG file. The main predicate `write_sierpinski_carpet` takes the file name, size, and order of the fractal as input and opens a stream to the file. It then writes the SVG header and a white rectangle to the stream. The `sierpinski_carpet` predicate recursively calculates the coordinates and size of the squares that make up the fractal and writes them to the SVG file. The `write_square` predicate is used to write the individual squares to the SVG file.
