This code generates a Sierpinski pentagon fractal and writes it to an SVG file. The main predicate calls the write_sierpinski_pentagon predicate with the file name, size, and order of the fractal as parameters. The write_sierpinski_pentagon predicate opens the file, writes the SVG header and background, calculates the dimensions and positioning of the pentagon, and then calls the sierpinski_pentagon predicate to generate the pentagon fractal. The sierpinski_pentagon predicate recursively generates the fractal by creating smaller pentagons within each larger pentagon. The write_pentagon_points predicate writes the points of the pentagon to the SVG file, and the sierpinski_pentagons predicate handles the recursive generation of the smaller pentagons within each larger pentagon.
