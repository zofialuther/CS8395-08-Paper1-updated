This code generates a Sierpinski triangle of a given order N using the Prolog language. It creates a graphical representation of the Sierpinski triangle by recursively dividing equilateral triangles into smaller equilateral triangles. The base case for the recursion is when N is 1, at which point it draws a single equilateral triangle. The code then uses the draw_Sierpinski predicate to recursively draw smaller triangles within the larger triangles until the desired order N is reached. The final result is displayed in a window using the SWI-Prolog graphical interface.
