This Prolog code implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of consecutive prime numbers less than or equal to a given number N. It uses a recursive approach to find the next non-prime number and then continues the process until all prime numbers are found. The code also includes a custom iterator and dynamic predicates declaration to avoid division and ensure the proper functioning of the algorithm.
