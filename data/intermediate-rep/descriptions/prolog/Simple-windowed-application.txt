This Prolog code creates a simple windowed application with a button that increases a click counter each time it is pressed. The application includes a label that initially displays the message "There have been no clicks yet." When the button is clicked, the label updates to show the current number of clicks. The code uses Prolog's dynamic predicate feature to keep track of the click count and updates the user interface accordingly. The `simple_windowed` predicate initializes and opens the windowed application.
