This Prolog code defines a predicate start/1 that takes a Port as input. It creates a socket using the 'AF_INET' protocol, connects to the localhost on the specified port, and sends the message 'hello socket world' through the socket. After sending the message, it closes the output connection and the input connection. This code could be used to establish a basic client-server connection using sockets in Prolog.
