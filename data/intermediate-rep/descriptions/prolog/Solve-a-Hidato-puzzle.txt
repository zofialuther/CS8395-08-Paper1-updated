This code is for solving a Hidato puzzle. The puzzle is initialized with a 10x10 grid and constraints are applied to ensure that the numbers in the grid form a valid Hidato puzzle. The code uses Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLPFD) to define the puzzle constraints and then solve the puzzle. Once the puzzle is solved, a function is included to display the result.
