This Prolog code implements a puzzle solver for a no_connection_puzzle. It defines a set of nodes and edges, and then constructs a list of values for the nodes such that connected nodes have different values by more than 1. The code uses Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLPFD) to solve the puzzle by setting constraints on the values of the nodes based on their connections. The code iterates through the nodes and their connections to ensure that the values assigned to the nodes satisfy the constraints.
