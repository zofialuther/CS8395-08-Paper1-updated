This code contains a series of Prolog unit tests for the sort_disjoint_sublist predicate. The tests cover various scenarios such as sorting disjoint sublists, handling edge cases, handling duplicate elements, and failing scenarios. The intermediate variable "R" is used to decouple processing by the predicate from subsequent checking against the expected result. The rt predicate is provided to run all the unit tests for the sort_disjoint_sublist predicate.
