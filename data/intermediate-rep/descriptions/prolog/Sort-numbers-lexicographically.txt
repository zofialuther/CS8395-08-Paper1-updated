This Prolog code defines a predicate `lexicographical_sort` that sorts a list of numbers in lexicographical order by first converting the numbers to strings, then sorting the strings, and finally converting the sorted strings back to numbers. It also includes predicates for creating a list of numbers, sorting them in lexicographical order, and a test predicate to demonstrate the sorting functionality. The `main` predicate calls the `test` predicate with different numbers to showcase the sorting results.
