This code is an implementation of the Bogo sort algorithm in Prolog. The bogo_sort predicate takes a list L and returns a randomly permuted version of the list in Rl, but only after checking if the list is sorted. The is_sorted predicate is used to check if the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted, the process is repeated until a sorted permutation is found. This algorithm is not practical for large lists due to its inefficiency.
