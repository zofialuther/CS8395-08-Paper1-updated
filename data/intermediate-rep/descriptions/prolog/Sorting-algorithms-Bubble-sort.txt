This code implements a bubble sort algorithm in Prolog. It includes a `bubble_sort` predicate that takes a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort technique. The `bubble_pass` predicate is used to perform a single pass of the bubble sort algorithm. The `main` predicate initializes the sorting process by calling the `test` predicate with an unsorted list and then passing the result to the `bubble_sort` predicate. Once the sorting is complete, the program halts.
