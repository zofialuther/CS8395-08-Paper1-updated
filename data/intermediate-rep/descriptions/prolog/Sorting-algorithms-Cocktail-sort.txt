The given code is a Prolog implementation of the Cocktail Sort algorithm. The cocktail/2 predicate takes an input list and produces a sorted output list using the cocktail sort algorithm. The ctail/5 predicate is recursively used within the cocktail/2 predicate to sort the elements in both forward and backward directions. The test/0 predicate is used to demonstrate the functionality of the cocktail/2 predicate by sorting a sample input list and printing the sorted output.
