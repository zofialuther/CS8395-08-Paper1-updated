This Prolog code defines a sorting algorithm called insert_sort, which takes a list L1 as input and returns the sorted list as L2. The sorting is done by recursively inserting elements into a new list in a way that maintains the ascending order. The insert_sort_intern predicate is used to perform the actual sorting by internally calling the insert predicate to insert elements into the new list. The insert predicate is defined to insert an element into a sorted list while maintaining the order.
