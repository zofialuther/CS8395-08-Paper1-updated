This code implements the merge sort algorithm in Prolog. The msort predicate takes a list L and returns a sorted copy S using the merge sort algorithm. The split predicate alternates elements of a list into two separate lists, and the merge predicate takes two sorted lists and returns a sorted merge of the two. This code allows for the efficient sorting of lists using the merge sort algorithm.
