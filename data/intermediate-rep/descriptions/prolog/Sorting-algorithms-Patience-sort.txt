This code implements the Patience Sort algorithm, which is a sorting algorithm that uses a set of piles to sort elements. The `patience_sort` predicate takes an unsorted list as input and returns the sorted list. The algorithm works by creating piles of elements from the unsorted list and then merging these piles to create the sorted list. The `make_piles` predicate is used to create the piles, while the `merge_piles` and `merge_pile` predicates are used to merge the piles to obtain the sorted list. Overall, this code provides a Prolog implementation of the Patience Sort algorithm.
