This code is a Prolog implementation of the quicksort algorithm. It defines a predicate "qsort" which takes a list and returns the sorted version of that list. The quicksort algorithm is implemented using a recursive approach, where the list is split into two parts based on a pivot element, and then the two parts are sorted recursively. The "splitBy" predicate is used to partition the list into elements less than or equal to the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. The sorted sublists are then appended together to form the final sorted list.
