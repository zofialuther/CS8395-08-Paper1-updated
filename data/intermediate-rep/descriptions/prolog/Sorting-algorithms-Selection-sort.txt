This code is a Prolog implementation of the selection sort algorithm. It defines a predicate `selection_sort` that takes a list as input and sorts it in ascending order. The `exchange` predicate is used to swap elements in the list to perform the sorting. The algorithm works by recursively finding the minimum element in the list and swapping it with the first element, then sorting the remaining elements.
