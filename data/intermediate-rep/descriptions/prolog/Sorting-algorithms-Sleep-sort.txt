This code implements a sorting algorithm called sleep sort using multithreading. The sleep_sort function creates a thread pool and then uses the initsort function to create a separate thread for each element in the input list. Each thread simply sleeps for a duration equal to the value of the element and then prints the value. After all threads have completed, the thread pool is destroyed. This unconventional sorting algorithm relies on the timing of the sleep operations to achieve the sorting effect.
