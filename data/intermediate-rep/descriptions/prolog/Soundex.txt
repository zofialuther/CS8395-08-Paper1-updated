This code implements the American Soundex algorithm in SWI Prolog. The algorithm converts a string of characters into a four-character code that represents the sound of the input string, primarily used for phonetic matching of similar-sounding names. The code includes functions to replace consonants with appropriate digits, strip elements from a string, handle adjacent digits, remove vowels, and ensure trailing zeroes. The `soundex` predicate prepares the input string, converts it to lowercase, and applies the Soundex algorithm. The `test` predicate performs tests to ensure that the correct Soundex values are produced for specific input strings.
