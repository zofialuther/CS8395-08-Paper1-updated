This code defines three predicates for implementing a stack data structure. The push predicate takes an element and a stack, and returns true if the new stack is formed by adding the element to the top of the original stack. The pop predicate takes a stack and returns true if the top element and the new stack (formed by removing the top element) are returned. The empty predicate returns true if the stack is empty.
