This Prolog code defines a state name puzzle that generates a list of US state names and then computes a Goedel number for each word. The code then sorts and removes duplicates from the list of Goedel numbers and performs a study of the resulting list to find combinations of state names that have the same Goedel number. Finally, it prints out any combinations that satisfy the specified conditions.
