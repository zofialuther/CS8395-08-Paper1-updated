This code defines a Prolog program that calculates and prints unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind. The program includes a dynamic cache for storing previously calculated values to improve efficiency. It also includes predicates for finding the maximum value of the Stirling numbers and a main predicate that prints the Stirling numbers up to a specified value and calculates the maximum value for a specific input. The main goal of the program is to demonstrate the calculation and printing of Stirling numbers and finding the maximum value for a given input.
