This code defines and calculates Stirling numbers of the second kind. It uses dynamic predicates to cache previously calculated values for efficiency. The `stirling2/3` predicate calculates Stirling numbers using recursion and memoization, while `print_stirling_numbers/1` prints the Stirling numbers for a given value of N. The `max_stirling2/2` predicate finds the maximum Stirling number for a given N. The `main` predicate demonstrates the use of these functions by printing Stirling numbers up to 12 and finding the maximum Stirling number for N = 100.
