This Prolog code defines predicates for checking if a list of elements starts with, contains, or ends with another list of elements. The `starts_with` predicate checks if the second list is the beginning of the first list. The `contains` predicate checks if the second list is contained within the first list at one or more positions, and the `contains` predicate with an additional argument checks if the second list is contained within the first list at a specific position. Finally, the `ends_with` predicate checks if the second list is the ending of the first list. The code uses the Prolog lists library for list manipulation.
