This Prolog code is designed to strip block comments from an input string and output the result. It first sets the Prolog flag to use double quotes as codes. The main predicate, strip_block_comments, takes an input and processes it to remove block comments, then formats the resulting output within triple backticks for use in Markdown. The helper predicate, strip_block_comments/2, uses Prolog's DCG (Definite Clause Grammar) to define the structure of block comments and recursively removes them from the input. The DCG rules define how to recognize block comments and remove them from the input string, effectively stripping them out. Overall, this code provides a useful tool for processing and formatting text by removing block comments.
