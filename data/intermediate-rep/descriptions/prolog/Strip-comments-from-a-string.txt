This Prolog code defines a predicate stripcomment/2 that removes comments from a string. The stripcomment/3 predicate takes an input string A and returns a modified string B with all comments removed. Comments are defined as anything following a semicolon (;) or hash (#) character until the end of the line. The start predicate demonstrates the usage of stripcomment/2 by taking an input string, removing the comments, and printing the modified string.
