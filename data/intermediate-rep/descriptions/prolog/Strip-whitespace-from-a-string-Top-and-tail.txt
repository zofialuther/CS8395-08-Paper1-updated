This code contains a series of Prolog predicates and DCG rules for stripping leading and trailing spaces from a list of characters. It sets the Prolog flag to use double quotes as character codes. The predicates strip_leading, strip_trailing, and strip_leading_and_trailing are defined to remove leading spaces, trailing spaces, and both leading and trailing spaces, respectively. The DCG rules define the logic for stripping the spaces and non-spaces from the input list of characters to produce the output list.
