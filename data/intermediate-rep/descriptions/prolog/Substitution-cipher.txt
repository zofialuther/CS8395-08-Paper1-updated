The provided code implements a simple substitution cipher in Prolog. The `cypher` predicate takes two arguments, `O` and `S`, and performs the encryption and decryption operations. The `sub_chars` predicate uses a base character set and a substitution character set to perform the character mapping. The `sub_char` predicate does the actual character substitution. The code allows for encryption of a given string `O` into a new string `S` and decryption of `S` back into `O`. This code is a basic example of how a substitution cipher can be implemented using Prolog.
