This code defines a Prolog predicate called remove_first_last_chars, which takes a string and removes the first and last characters from it. The code uses the remove_last predicate to remove the last character, and then further manipulates the string to remove the first character as well. Finally, the code prints the original string, the string without the first character, the string without the last character, and the string without the first and last characters.
