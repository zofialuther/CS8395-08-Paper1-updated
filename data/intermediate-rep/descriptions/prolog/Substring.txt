This code defines a Prolog predicate called substring_task that takes a string Str, starting index N, length M, a character Char, and a variable SubStr as input. It then performs several operations on the input string, including extracting a substring from index N to M, extracting a substring from index N to the end of the string, extracting the string without the last character, and extracting a substring from a known character to index M. It also prints the results of each operation using the maplist predicate. Additionally, the code includes a helper predicate string_from_substring_to_m that extracts a substring from a specified index to M.
