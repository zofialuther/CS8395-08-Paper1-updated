This Prolog code is a program for generating and analyzing prime numbers. It includes a predicate to check if a number is prime, as well as various predicates for manipulating and analyzing lists of prime numbers. The `do` predicate is used to run the program, generating a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit and then analyzing the distribution of prime numbers based on different differences between consecutive primes. The code also includes predicates for timing and formatting the output of the analysis. Overall, this code is a comprehensive tool for working with prime numbers in Prolog.
