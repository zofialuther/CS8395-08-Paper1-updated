This code defines a predicate digit_sum/3 that calculates the sum of the digits of a number N in a given Base. It uses recursion to divide the number by the base and add the remainder to the sum. The test_digit_sum/2 predicate is used to test the digit_sum predicate with different numbers and bases. The main predicate calls test_digit_sum with various inputs to demonstrate the functionality of digit_sum.
