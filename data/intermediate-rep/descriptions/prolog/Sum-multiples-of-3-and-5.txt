This code calculates the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 up to a given number N. It uses a recursive approach to iterate through the multiples and add them to the sum. If a multiple is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is only added once to the sum. The code first calls the sum_of_multiples_of_3_and_5_slow predicate, passing in the number N and an accumulator variable TT. This predicate then calls the sum_of_multiples_of_3_and_5 predicate with initial values for K (1) and S (0), and the final sum is returned in TT.
