This Prolog code represents a simple tic-tac-toe game where the player can play against the computer. The game window is displayed graphically using PCE (Prolog Constraint Environment). The game logic is implemented using Prolog predicates and the minmax algorithm for the computer's move. The code allows the player to make the first move and the computer to make the next move using the minmax algorithm to determine the best move. The game evaluates winning, losing, and draw positions and displays the outcome accordingly. The tic-tac-toe board is displayed on the window and the player can click on the boxes to make their move. The code also defines a tic_tac_toe_box class for graphical display and interaction. Overall, the code creates a simple interactive tic-tac-toe game with a basic AI opponent.
