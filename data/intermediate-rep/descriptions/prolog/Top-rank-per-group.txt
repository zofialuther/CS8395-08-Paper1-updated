This code defines a set of employee data and their respective departments, as well as a series of rules for finding and reporting the highest salaried employees within each department. The "topDeps" predicate is used to calculate and report the list of highest salaried employees per department, based on a specified number of top employees (N). The code utilizes recursion to iterate through each department, find the top employees within each department, and then output the department name along with the IDs, names, and salaries of the top employees.
