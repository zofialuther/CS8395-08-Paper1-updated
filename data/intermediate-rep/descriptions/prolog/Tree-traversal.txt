This Prolog code defines a tree data structure and provides functions to traverse the tree in different orders. The tree is represented as a list where each element is a node with its left and right children. The code includes functions to perform preorder, inorder, postorder, and level-order traversals of the tree. The output of each traversal is printed to the console. The code uses recursion and difference lists to efficiently traverse the tree in different orders.
