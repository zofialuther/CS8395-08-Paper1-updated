This code defines predicates to find the largest left-truncatable prime and the largest right-truncatable prime less than a given number N. It includes functions to check if a number is prime, left-truncatable prime, and right-truncatable prime. The main function finds the prime numbers up to N and then uses the other predicates to find the largest left-truncatable prime and right-truncatable prime less than N, and displays the results.
