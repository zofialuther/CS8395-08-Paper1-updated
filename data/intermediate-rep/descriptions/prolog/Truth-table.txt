This code takes a line of text as input and evaluates a truth table for the given logical expression. It follows three steps: tokenizing the input into atoms and brackets, converting it into a evaluatable term, and evaluating the expression for each permutation of variables. The code then prints out the truth table for the expression, showing the results for each permutation of variable values. It uses a series of predicates to parse the input, evaluate the expression, and handle logical operations such as 'and', 'or', 'not', and 'nand'.
