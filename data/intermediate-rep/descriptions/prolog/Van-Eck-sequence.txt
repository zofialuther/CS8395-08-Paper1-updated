This Prolog code defines the Van Eck sequence and provides a way to generate and display the sequence. The Van Eck sequence is a series of numbers where each term is determined by the previous term's position in the sequence. The code includes predicates for initializing the sequence, generating the next term, and displaying a portion of the sequence. The main predicate calls the necessary functions to generate and display the first 10 terms as well as terms 991 to 1000 of the Van Eck sequence.
