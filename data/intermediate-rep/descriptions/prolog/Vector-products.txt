This code defines predicates for computing the dot product and cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors, as well as computing the scalar triple product and vector triple product of three 3-dimensional vectors. The dot_product predicate calculates the dot product of two vectors, the cross_product predicate calculates the cross product of two vectors, the scala_triple predicate computes the scalar triple product of three vectors, and the vector_triple predicate computes the vector triple product of three vectors. These predicates are useful for performing vector operations in 3-dimensional space.
