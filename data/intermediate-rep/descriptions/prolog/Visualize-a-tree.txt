This Prolog code defines a predicate display_tree/1 that takes a single argument Direction, which can be set to "horizontal", "vertical", or "list". The predicate creates a window and a tree structure with a root node and multiple child nodes, and sets the direction of the tree based on the input argument. The tree is then displayed in the window, with the nodes arranged according to the specified direction. This code can be used to visualize hierarchical data structures in a graphical user interface.
