This code sets up a Voronoi diagram on a 400x400 grid with a specified number of random sites (V) and distance calculation method (Manhattan, Euclidean, Minkowski). It uses dynamic predicates for points and defines a foldl predicate for functional-style processing. The Voronoi function creates a window and image for the diagram, and then determines the nearest site for each pixel using the specified distance function. Finally, the code includes three distance calculation methods: Manhattan, Euclidean, and Minkowski.
