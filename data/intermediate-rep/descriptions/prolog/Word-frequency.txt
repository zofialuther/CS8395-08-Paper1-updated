This Prolog code is designed to read a text file, count the frequency of each word, and then print the top N most frequently occurring words along with their counts. The code first reads the contents of the file, splits it into individual words, converts the words to lowercase, and then merges the duplicate words while adding up their counts. It then sorts the words based on their counts and prints the top N words with their respective counts in a tabular format. The main predicate "main" calls the "print_top_words" predicate to display the top 10 words from the file "135-0.txt".
