This code implements the Y combinator, a higher-order function in functional programming that enables the definition of recursive functions in a language that doesn't natively support recursion. It demonstrates the Y combinator by using it to define and calculate the Fibonacci and factorial functions. The code includes the implementation of both functions and then uses the Y combinator to calculate the Fibonacci of 10 and the factorial of 10, displaying the results.
