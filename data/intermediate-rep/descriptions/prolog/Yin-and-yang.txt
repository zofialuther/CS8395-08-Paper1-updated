This code defines a predicate ying_yang that takes an input N and creates a graphical representation of the Yin Yang symbol with size based on N. It creates a window with the title "Yin Yang N" and draws the symbol using semi-disks and disks with different colors. The semi_disk and disk classes define the shapes and colors used in the graphical representation. The code utilizes the PCE (Prolog Constraint Environment) library for creating graphical user interfaces in Prolog.
