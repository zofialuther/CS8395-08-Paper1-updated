The code uses the Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLPFD) library to solve the Zebra puzzle, a logic puzzle that involves determining the nationality, house color, cigarette brand, pet, and favorite drink of five individuals living in five different houses. The code defines the variables for the five categories and their corresponding constraints, then uses the CLPFD library to solve the puzzle and print the solution.
