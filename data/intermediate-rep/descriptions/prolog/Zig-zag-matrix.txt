This Prolog code defines a predicate zig_zag that generates a matrix of zig-zag numbers based on the input N. The zig_zag predicate calls another predicate with the same name to compute the zig-zag matrix for a given number of lines and columns. The code uses recursive fill and compute_next predicates to populate the matrix with the zig-zag numbers and determine the direction of movement. Finally, the code includes print_line and print_val predicates to display the generated matrix.
