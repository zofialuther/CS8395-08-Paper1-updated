This Python code utilizes the Tkinter graphical user interface to create a 15 Puzzle Game. The Board class initializes the game board with randomized game squares and ensures the solvability of the game. The Square class represents individual squares on the game board. The Game class sets up the game window, handles the creation of the game board, and allows for interaction with the game squares. When a square is clicked, the code processes the move and checks if the game has been won. The main program creates the Tkinter window, sets its title and dimensions, and initializes the game. The game window allows for playing and restarting the game.
