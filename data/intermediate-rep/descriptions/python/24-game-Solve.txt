This Python code defines a function to solve the 24 game, which involves using arithmetic operations to combine four numbers to make 24. The code uses a recursive approach to find all possible combinations of operations and numbers to reach the target number of 24. It handles cases where no solution is found for a given set of numbers. The code includes a set of test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the solve24 function.
