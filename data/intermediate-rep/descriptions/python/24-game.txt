This code generates a simple game where the player is given 4 random numbers and a set of mathematical operators. The player is then prompted to enter an expression using the numbers and operators in an attempt to equal 24. The code checks the validity of the player's input and provides feedback on whether the input is valid and if the result equals 24. The game continues until the player chooses to quit or enters the correct expression.
