This Python code includes a function called "all_equal" that takes seven arguments and checks if the sums of their pairwise combinations are equal. The main function "foursquares" takes a range of numbers and generates unique or non-unique combinations of seven numbers within that range. It then iterates through these combinations, checks if they satisfy the "all_equal" condition, and prints out the solutions if required. Finally, it prints the total number of unique or non-unique solutions found within the specified range.
