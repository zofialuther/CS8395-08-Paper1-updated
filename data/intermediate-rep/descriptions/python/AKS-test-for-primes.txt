The code includes two functions. The first function, expand_x_1, utilizes a generator to efficiently compute and yield the coefficients of the expansion of (1+x)^n. The second function, aks, checks if a given number p is a prime number using the AKS primality test. It iterates through the coefficients generated by the expand_x_1 function and returns False if any of the coefficients are not divisible by p, indicating that p is not a prime number. If all coefficients are divisible by p, the function returns True, indicating that p is a prime number. The usage of a generator in the expand_x_1 function allows for less computational overhead.
