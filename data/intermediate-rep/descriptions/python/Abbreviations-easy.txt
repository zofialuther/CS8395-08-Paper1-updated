This code takes a command table text and user input words and finds the minimal abbreviation length for each word by counting capital letters. It then creates a dictionary of abbreviations for each command. The code also parses the user input string and matches it with the abbreviations to generate the full command words. Finally, it prints the user input words and their corresponding full command words.
