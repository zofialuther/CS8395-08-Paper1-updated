This code defines a function called ack2 that calculates the Ackermann function using memoization with the lru_cache decorator. The Ackermann function is a recursive mathematical function that takes two non-negative integer parameters M and N and returns a result based on specific conditions. The function uses a combination of if-else statements to handle different scenarios and recursively calls itself to calculate the result. The lru_cache decorator is used to cache and reuse the results of previous function calls, improving performance by avoiding redundant calculations.
