This code takes a text file with columns of fields delineated by a dollar character and aligns each column by ensuring that words in each column are separated by at least one space. It also allows for each word in a column to be left, right, or center justified within its column. The code defines a function called `aligner` which takes the input file and the justification type as parameters and returns the justified output as a string. The code then loops through the three justification types (Left, Right, and Center) and prints the column-aligned output for each type. The code achieves this by manipulating the input data to calculate the maximum field width per column and padding the fields in columns to the calculated width with spaces.
