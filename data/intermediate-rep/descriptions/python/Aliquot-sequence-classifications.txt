This Python code defines a function that calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number. It then uses this function to determine the type of aliquot sequence for a range of numbers. An aliquot sequence is a series of numbers where each term is the sum of the proper divisors of the previous term. The code prints the type of each sequence, such as perfect, amicable, sociable, aspiring, cyclic, or non-terminating, for a range of input numbers.
