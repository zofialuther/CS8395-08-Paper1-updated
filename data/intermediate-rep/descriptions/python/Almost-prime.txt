This Python code defines a function to calculate the prime factors of a given number, as well as a function to find k-almost-prime numbers within a specified range. A k-almost-prime number is a positive integer with exactly k prime factors, counting multiplicity. The code generates and prints lists of k-almost-prime numbers for different values of k within the specified range. The example at the end of the code demonstrates how to call the function with different parameters to find k-almost-prime numbers within a larger range.
