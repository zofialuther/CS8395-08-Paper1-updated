This Python code defines a class called Amb, which is used to represent non-deterministic choice in logic programming. It includes methods for defining constraints, iterating through possible solutions, and implementing the Amb operator for solving problems. The code also includes examples of using the Amb class to solve the Pythagorean triples problem, the Rosetta Code Amb problem, and an Amb problem from a specific source.
