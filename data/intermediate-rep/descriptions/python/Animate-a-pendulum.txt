This Python code uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface that animates a pendulum. The pendulum consists of a rod and a bob, and the animation simulates the swinging motion of the pendulum. The code calculates the coordinates of the rod and bob based on the angle and updates the canvas to create the visual effect of the pendulum swinging back and forth. The animation is achieved by recursively calling the `animate` method with a slight delay using the `after` method. The graphical user interface is set up with a window titled "Pendulum" and dimensions of 600x400 pixels.
