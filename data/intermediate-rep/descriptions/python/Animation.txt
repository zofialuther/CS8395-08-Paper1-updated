This Python code creates a simple marquee effect using PyQt5 library. The Marquee class inherits from QLabel and the text of the label continuously moves from right to left. The direction of the movement can be changed by clicking the mouse. The window is frameless and translucent, displaying the text "Hello World!" in a bold, cyan-colored font. The application exits when the "Escape" key is pressed. When executed, the marquee text is displayed in the center of the screen.
