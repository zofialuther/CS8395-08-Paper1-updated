This Python code defines a function to calculate the factors of a given number, as well as a generator to yield numbers that have a large number of factors. The `factors` function uses prime power decomposition to efficiently calculate the factors of a number. The `antiprimes` generator yields numbers that have the highest number of factors, up to a certain limit. When executed, the code prints the first 40 numbers with the highest number of factors.
