This code defines a function called arithmetic that takes two parameters, x and y. Within the function, a for loop iterates through a list of arithmetic operators (+, -, *, //, %, **). For each operator, an expression is created using the format method and the vars function to insert the values of x, y, and the operator. The expression is then printed along with the result of evaluating it using the eval function. The arithmetic function is called twice, first with the arguments 12 and 8, and then with user input for two numbers. This code essentially demonstrates the usage of various arithmetic operators and how to dynamically create and evaluate expressions using them.
