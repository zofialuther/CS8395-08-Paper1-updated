This code defines a function called agm that calculates the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) of two input values. The AGM is calculated using a while loop to iteratively update the values of a and g until the absolute difference between them is less than the specified tolerance. The precision of the decimal values is set to 70 decimal places using getcontext().prec. The code then calls the agm function with initial values and prints the result.
