This code creates four lists, arr1, arr2, arr3, and arr4. The first three lists contain integer elements, while arr4 is a combination of arr1 and arr2 using the "+" operator. The code then asserts that arr4 is equal to the combined elements of arr1 and arr2. It then extends arr4 with the elements of arr3 and asserts that arr4 is now equal to the combined elements of arr1, arr2, and arr3.
