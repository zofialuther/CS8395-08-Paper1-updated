This code initializes a 2D array called 'my_array' with a height and width specified by the variables 'height' and 'width'. It uses a for loop to iterate over the range of 'height' and appends a new list of zeros, with a length of 'width', to 'my_array' for each iteration. This effectively creates a 2D array filled with zeros.
