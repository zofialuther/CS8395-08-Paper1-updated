This code creates a dictionary called myDict with three key-value pairs. It then demonstrates how to iterate over the key-value pairs, keys, and values using for loops. The code first prints the key and value for each pair, then prints only the keys, and finally prints only the values. This code provides a comprehensive example of how to iterate over the elements of a dictionary in Python.
