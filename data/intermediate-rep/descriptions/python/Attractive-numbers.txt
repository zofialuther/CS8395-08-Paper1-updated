This code uses the sympy library to find the prime factors of a given number. It first extends the list of prime numbers up to 110 using the sieve function. Then, it calculates the prime factors of numbers from 0 to 120 using the get_pfct function and stores them in a list called pool. Finally, it checks if the number of prime factors is a prime number and prints the index of those numbers.
