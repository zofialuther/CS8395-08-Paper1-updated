The given code defines a function called median that takes an array as input and returns the median value of the array. The median is calculated by first sorting the array, then finding the middle value if the array has an odd number of elements, or the average of the two middle values if the array has an even number of elements. 

The code then provides two example arrays, calculates their median using the defined function, and prints the original array and its median value.
