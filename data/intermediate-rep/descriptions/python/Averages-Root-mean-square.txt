This code defines a function called qmean which takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the quadratic mean (also known as root mean square) of the numbers. It does this by squaring each number, summing the squares, dividing by the number of elements in the list, and then taking the square root of the result. The code then uses this function to calculate the quadratic mean of the numbers from 1 to 10, which is approximately 6.2048.
