This Python code uses the NumPy library to create a function called gen that generates a random string of balanced square brackets. It then defines a function called balanced that uses NumPy to check if a given string of square brackets is balanced. The code then iterates through a range of numbers, generating random strings of brackets and checking if they are balanced using the balanced function. The output shows the generated string and whether it is balanced or not.
