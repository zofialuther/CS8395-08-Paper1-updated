This code is a Python script that demonstrates Benford's Law by comparing the leading digit distribution of different sequences. It imports various modules such as itertools, collections, math, and random. The script defines functions for generating a Fibonacci sequence, powers of three, extracting leading digits, calculating the distribution of leading digits, and generating random numbers. It then uses these functions to calculate and display the deviation from Benford's Law for the Fibonacci sequence, powers of three sequence, and a set of random numbers. The output of the script provides a comparison of the actual leading digit distribution with the expected distribution based on Benford's Law.
