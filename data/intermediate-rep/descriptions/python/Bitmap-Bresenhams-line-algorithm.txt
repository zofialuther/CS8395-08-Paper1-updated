This code defines a function called "line" that draws a line on a bitmap image. The function takes the starting and ending coordinates of the line as input and uses the Bresenham's line algorithm to calculate the points that the line passes through. It then sets these points on the bitmap image. The function also handles cases where the line is vertical or the end point is before the starting point. Finally, the function is added to the Bitmap class as a method.
