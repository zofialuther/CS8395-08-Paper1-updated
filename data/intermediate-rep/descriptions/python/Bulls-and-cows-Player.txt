This code is a Bulls & Cows game where the player has to guess a sequence of unique digits. The code uses permutations and shuffle from itertools and random modules to generate the possible choices and shuffle them. The player is prompted to guess a sequence, and their score is calculated based on the number of correct digits in the correct position (bulls) and the number of correct digits in the wrong position (cows). The game continues until the player guesses the correct sequence or no choices fit the given scores.
