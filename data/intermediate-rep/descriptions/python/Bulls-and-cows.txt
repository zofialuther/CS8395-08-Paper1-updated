This code represents a simple implementation of the Bulls and Cows game, which is a number guessing game that predates and is similar to the game Mastermind. The program generates a random 4-digit number with unique digits from 1 to 9, and the user has to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of "bulls" and "cows" to indicate how many digits in the guess are correct and in the correct position (bulls) or correct but in the wrong position (cows). The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
