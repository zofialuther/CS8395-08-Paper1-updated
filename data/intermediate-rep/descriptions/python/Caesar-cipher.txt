This code defines a function called caesar that takes a string and a key as input and uses the Caesar cipher to either encode or decode the string based on the key. The Caesar cipher is a form of encryption that shifts each letter in the input string by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. The code also includes an example of how to use the caesar function to encode and then decode a message.
