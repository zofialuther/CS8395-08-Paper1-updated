This Python code defines a series generator and a function to convert a rational number into a continued fraction. The `cw` function is a generator that yields terms from a specific series. The `r2cf` function converts a rational number into a continued fraction representation. The `get_term_num` function calculates the nth term of the series for a given rational number. The code then demonstrates the use of these functions by printing the first 20 terms of the series and calculating the nth term for a specific rational number.
