This code defines a class `Isprime` that implements an extensible sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check for prime numbers. It also includes a function `carmichael` that generates a list of tuples representing Carmichael numbers. The code then creates an instance of `Isprime` with a maximum value of 2 and uses it to find Carmichael numbers for a range of values up to 62. The results are then printed in a formatted manner.
