This Python code includes a function that implements memoization to store and reuse the results of other functions, specifically for calculating factorials and Catalan numbers. The main function demonstrates the use of memoization with these functions to calculate and print a table of results for direct Catalan number calculation, recursive Catalan number calculation using a simple formula, and recursive Catalan number calculation using a more efficient formula.
