This Python code sets up a simple chat server that allows multiple users to connect and communicate with each other. It uses socket programming to handle incoming connections and messages. When a user connects, they are prompted to enter their name, and once entered, they are added to a dictionary of users. Messages are then broadcasted to all users, and the server continuously listens for new connections and incoming messages from existing users. The code also includes error handling for socket connections and disconnections.
