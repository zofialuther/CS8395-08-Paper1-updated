This Python code calculates the Chinese Remainder Theorem using the functions `chinese_remainder` and `mul_inv`. The `chinese_remainder` function takes two lists, `n` and `a`, representing the divisors and remainders, and returns the solution for the system of linear congruences. The `mul_inv` function calculates the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number. The code also includes an example that demonstrates the usage of the `chinese_remainder` function with the given values of `n` and `a`.
