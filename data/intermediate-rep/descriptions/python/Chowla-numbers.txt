This Python code is a collection of functions that calculate and identify certain types of numbers. The `chowla` function returns the Chowla number for a given input, which is calculated as the sum of the divisors of the input minus 1 and the input itself. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime using the Chowla number. The `primes_to` function counts the number of prime numbers up to a given limit using the Chowla number. The `perfect_between` function identifies and counts perfect numbers within a specified range using the Chowla number. The code then tests and prints the results of these functions for various inputs, including large numbers.
