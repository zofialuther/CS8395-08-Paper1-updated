This code includes functions to check if a number is prime using the Miller-Rabin test, find all rotations of a number, determine if a number is circular prime, and generate a list of circular primes. It also includes a function to find the first n repunit primes. The main function uses these functions to find and return a list of circular primes. Finally, the code tests the functions using sample inputs and assertions.
