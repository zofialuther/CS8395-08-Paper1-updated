This Python code computes the nearest pair of points using two different algorithms. The first algorithm is a 'brute force' comparison of every possible pair, while the second algorithm is a 'divide and conquer' approach. The 'divide and conquer' algorithm is based on a specific method outlined in a PowerPoint presentation. The code includes functions to perform the computations and compare the execution time of the different algorithms. The program also generates random 2D points and tests both algorithms on the generated data.
