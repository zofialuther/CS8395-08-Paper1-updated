This Python code uses the fractions and itertools libraries to implement a Continued Fraction algorithm. It defines functions to calculate the Continued Fraction for the square root of 2, Napier's Constant (e), and Pi to a specified number of terms. It then approximates the result as a string and prints it out. The code demonstrates the calculation of Continued Fractions for these mathematical constants and provides their approximations.
