This code defines a function called "duration" that takes a number of seconds as input and converts it into a human-readable format representing the duration in weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It then includes a loop that demonstrates the function's usage by converting and displaying the duration for three different input values (7259 seconds, 86400 seconds, and 6000000 seconds). The output shows the converted durations for each input value in a clear and understandable format.
