This Python code implements Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway. The code initializes a universe grid with different patterns such as a blinker, toad, glider, and random start, and then simulates the evolution of the grid over a maximum of 3 generations. The rules for the evolution are defined in the celltable dictionary, where the keys represent the different states of the neighboring cells that lead to life. The code then iterates through each generation, updating the state of each cell based on the rules, and printing the grid at each iteration.
