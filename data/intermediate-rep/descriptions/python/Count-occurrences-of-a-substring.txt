This code demonstrates the use of the count method in Python to count the occurrences of a specific substring within a given string. The first example counts the occurrences of the substring "th" in the string "the three truths", which returns a count of 3. The second example counts the occurrences of the substring "abab" in the string "ababababab", resulting in a count of 2.
