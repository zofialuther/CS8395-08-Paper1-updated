The code begins by attempting to import the "psyco" module, which is a specializing just-in-time compiler for Python. If successful, it enables full optimization. If it fails to import, the code moves on without any action.

The main function of the code is the "count_changes" function, which takes in an amount in cents and a list of coin denominations, and calculates the number of ways the amount can be made using the given coins.

The code then includes a main function that tests the "count_changes" function with different amounts and sets of coins (US and EU denominations) and prints the results.

Overall, this code is designed to optimize and calculate the number of ways to make a certain amount using different coin denominations.
