This Python code is a program that determines the years between 2008 and 2121 in which December 25th falls on a Sunday. It uses the datetime module to calculate the day of the week for December 25th in each year and filters the results to find the desired years. The code includes generic functions for integer enumeration and indexing, as well as a formatting function for creating a tabular string. When executed, the program prints the years when December 25th is a Sunday along with the total count of such years.
