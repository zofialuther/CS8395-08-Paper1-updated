This Python code is a program that determines if a given string has all the same characters. It contains a function called firstDifferingCharLR, which takes a string as input and returns either a message reporting that no character changes were seen, or a dictionary with details of the first character (if any) that differs from that at the head of the string. The code also includes a test function called main, which tests the firstDifferingCharLR function with 7 different strings and prints the results. The code also includes some generic functions for working with Either types, as well as a function for creating tabular string output.
