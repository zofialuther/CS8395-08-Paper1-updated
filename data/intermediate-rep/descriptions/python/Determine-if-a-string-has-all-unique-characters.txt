This Python code is designed to determine if a given string has all unique characters. It includes a function called `duplicatedCharIndices` which takes a string input and returns the first duplicated character along with the indices of its occurrence, or `Nothing` if there are no duplications. The code also includes a `main` function for testing over various strings and includes various helper functions for formatting, working with Maybe types, and manipulating lists.
