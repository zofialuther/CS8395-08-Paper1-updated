This code defines a function called "collapser" that takes a string as input and removes consecutive duplicate characters, returning the collapsed version of the string. The code then applies this function to a list of strings and prints the original and collapsed versions, along with their respective sizes. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the functionality of the "collapser" function and show the reduction in size achieved by collapsing consecutive duplicate characters in the strings.
