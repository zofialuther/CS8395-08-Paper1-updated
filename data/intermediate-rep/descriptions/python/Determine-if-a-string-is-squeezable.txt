This Python code defines a function called `squeezer` that takes a string `s` and text `txt` as input and returns a modified version of `txt` where all instances of `s` are removed. It uses the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module.

The main part of the code contains a list of strings and a list of characters to be used as "squeezers". It then iterates through the strings and corresponding squeeezers and prints the original string and the modified string after applying the `squeezer` function with each character from the squeeezer list.
