This Python code defines a series of functions to calculate the digital root and additive persistence of integers. It includes a main function that prints a tabulated output of the digital root and additive persistence for a list of integers. The code utilizes functional programming concepts such as composition and higher-order functions like reduce and map. The until function is used to repeatedly apply a function until a certain condition is met.
