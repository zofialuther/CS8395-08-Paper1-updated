This Python code defines a Graph class that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices. It initializes a graph with edges and their associated costs, and then uses the Dijkstra method to calculate the shortest path between a given source and destination vertex. The code utilizes collections like namedtuple and deque, as well as pprint for pretty printing the results.
