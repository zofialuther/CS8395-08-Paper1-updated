This Python code simulates the dining philosopher problem using the multiprocessing module. The program creates independent philosopher processes that simulate thinking and dining using random schedules. The main routine sets up the philosophers, chopsticks, and runs the simulation for a specified duration. The code also includes different methods for the philosophers to grab chopsticks, as well as a performance report function to analyze wait times. The program aims to show the potential for deadlocks and gather statistics on philosopher behavior.
