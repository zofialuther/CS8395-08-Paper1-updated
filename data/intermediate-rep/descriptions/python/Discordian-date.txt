This Python code calculates the Discordian date (ddate) based on the input year, month, and day. It uses the Discordian calendar, which consists of five seasons: Chaos, Discord, Confusion, Bureaucracy, and The Aftermath. The code also accounts for leap years, including the special date "St. Tib's Day," and adjusts the day of the year accordingly. The output is the Discordian date in the format "Season Day, YOLD Year."
