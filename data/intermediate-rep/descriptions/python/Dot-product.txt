This code defines a function to calculate the dot product of two vectors, handling cases where the vectors have different sizes. The dotProduct function returns either the dot product of the input vectors or a string indicating that the vector sizes differ. The main function demonstrates the dotProduct function by calculating the dot product of the vector [1, 3, -5] with four other vectors and displaying the results in a tabular format. The code also includes various utility functions for working with Either types, function composition, and formatting tabular data.
