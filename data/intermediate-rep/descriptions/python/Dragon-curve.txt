This Python code uses the turtle module to create a recursive function called dragon. This function takes in two parameters, step and length, and calls another function called dcr. The dcr function then decreases the step by 1 and divides the length by 1.41421. If the step is greater than 0, it continues to recursively call dcr and dcl while adjusting the turtle's position. If the step is 0, it moves the turtle forward and to the left and right at certain angles. The dcl function behaves similarly to dcr, but with different angle adjustments. This code ultimately creates a visual representation of a dragon curve using the turtle graphics.
