The given code is a Python program that creates a 3D cuboid shape using ASCII characters. The `cuboid` function takes three parameters, representing the dimensions of the cuboid, and returns a string that visually represents the cuboid. The `_pr` function is a helper function that formats the cuboid using the provided dimensions and spacing. The program also includes a conditional check for debug mode and a main block that demonstrates the functionality by printing out three different cuboids with varying dimensions.
