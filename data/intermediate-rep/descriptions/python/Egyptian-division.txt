This Python code implements the Egyptian division method using a custom function called `egyptian_divmod`. The function takes in a dividend and a divisor and returns the quotient and remainder of the division. It uses a while loop and lists to calculate the powers and doubles of the divisor, then iterates through these lists to find the quotient and remainder. The code also includes a test to compare the results of the custom function with Python's built-in `divmod` function. Finally, it demonstrates the use of the `egyptian_divmod` function by dividing 580 by 34 and printing the result as a string.
