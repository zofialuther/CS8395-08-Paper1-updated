The code defines a function called eca that implements a one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton (ECA) and yields the resulting cells based on a given rule. It then uses the function to generate multiple lines of ECA output with different rules and prints the results in a visually interpretable format. The main function demonstrates the functionality of the eca function by producing and displaying 50 lines of output for three different rules.
