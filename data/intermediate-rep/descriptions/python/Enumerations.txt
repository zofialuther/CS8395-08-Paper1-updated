This code defines an enumeration called Contact using the Enum class from the enum module. It creates three members of the enumeration: FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, and PHONE. The code then demonstrates two ways of creating the same enumeration: using the Enum function and explicitly defining the enumeration with class Contact2. Finally, it displays the members of both enumerations using the __members__ attribute.
