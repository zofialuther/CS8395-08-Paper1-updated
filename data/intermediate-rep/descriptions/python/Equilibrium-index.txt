This code defines a function called eqindexMultiPass which takes a list of integers as input. The function returns a list of indices where the sum of the elements before that index is equal to the sum of the elements after that index. The function uses list comprehension to iterate through the indices of the input list and check for the equality of the sums. The code then calls the function with a specific input list and prints the result.
