This code implements the "Ethiopian multiplication" algorithm, which is a method for multiplying two numbers using only the operations of halving, doubling, and addition. The main function `ethMult` takes two integers `n` and `m` and returns the product of these numbers using the Ethiopian multiplication method. The code also includes helper functions for doubling, halving, and adding where odd, as well as generic functions for iterating, showing logs, and unfolding. The `main` function tests the multiplication using the `ethMult` function.
