This Python code finds pairs of numbers (i, j) such that i^5 + j^5 equals another number within the range of 1 to 250. It uses dictionaries to store the values and then iterates through them to find the pairs that satisfy the condition. The code then prints out the pairs that meet the criteria and exits the program.
