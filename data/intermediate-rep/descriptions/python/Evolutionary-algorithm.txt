This code is a Python implementation of the "Weasel Program" which is a thought experiment in evolution. The program starts with a random sequence of characters and then evolves the sequence through random mutations and natural selection to match a target sequence "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL". The fitness of the sequence is determined by the number of matching characters. The program tracks the iterations and fitness of the evolving sequence, and prints the progress every 100 iterations. The mutation rate decreases as the fitness of the sequence improves, simulating natural selection. The program continues to iterate until the sequence matches the target.
