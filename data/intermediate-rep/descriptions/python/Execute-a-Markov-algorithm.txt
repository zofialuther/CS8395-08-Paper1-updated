This Python code includes functions to extract replacements from a grammar and then apply those replacements to a given text. The `extractreplacements` function uses regular expressions to find and extract replacement rules from a given grammar. The `replace` function then applies these replacements to a given text. The code includes several example grammars and texts, along with assertions to test the functionality of the replacement and extraction functions.
