This Python code generates a Farey sequence and calculates the number of terms in the sequence for a given order. The Farey sequence is a series of rational numbers between 0 and 1, with all of its terms in lowest terms and in increasing order. The code includes functions to generate the sequence, calculate its length, and display the sequence in a readable format. It also includes a test function to demonstrate the functionality of the code.
