This code is an implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in Python. It takes an input array 'x' and calculates its discrete Fourier transform. The function 'fft' recursively divides the input array into even and odd parts, applies the FFT to each part, and then combines the results to obtain the final transform. The code then prints the absolute values of the FFT coefficients for a specific input array.
