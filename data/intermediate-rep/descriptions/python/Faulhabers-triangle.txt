This Python code implements Faulhaber's Triangle, a triangular array of fractions that represents the sum of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers. The faulhaberTriangle function generates the list of rows of Faulhaber fractions, while the faulhaberSum function calculates the sum of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers. The code also includes test cases and display functions for tabular output.
