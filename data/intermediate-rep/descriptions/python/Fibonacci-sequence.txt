This Python code uses a functional approach to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci series. It defines a function `nthFib` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth term of the Fibonacci series. The code uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module and the `add` function from the `operator` module to efficiently calculate the Fibonacci term. The main section of the code demonstrates the usage of the `nthFib` function by printing the 1000th term of the Fibonacci series.
