This Python code defines several functions for filtering a list of numbers based on whether they are even or odd. The functions use different approaches, from using list comprehensions to built-in filter functions and fold operations. The `main` function tests these filtering functions by applying them to a range of numbers and displaying the results. The code also includes generic utility functions such as `concatMap` for mapping over lists and `showReturn` for extracting the return expressions from function bodies. Overall, the code showcases different functional filtering techniques in Python, with a focus on descending generality and increasing brevity in the implementation.
