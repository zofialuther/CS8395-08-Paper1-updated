This code defines a function called LinePlaneCollision that calculates the intersection point between a plane and a ray in three-dimensional space. The function takes in the normal vector and a point on the plane, as well as the direction vector and a point on the ray. It uses vector operations to compute the intersection point and returns the result. The main part of the code demonstrates how to use the function by defining a plane and a ray, and then calling the function to find the intersection point.
