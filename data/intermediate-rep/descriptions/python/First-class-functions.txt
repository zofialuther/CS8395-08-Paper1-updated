This Python code demonstrates the concept of first-class functions, which are functions that can be treated as first-class objects, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. The code includes functions for function composition, currying, flipping the order of function arguments, and zipping two lists together with a custom function. The main function uses these generic functions to compose a series of mathematical functions and then applies them to a list of numbers.
