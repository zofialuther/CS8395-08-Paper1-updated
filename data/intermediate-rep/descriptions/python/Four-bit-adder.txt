The code provided is a Python implementation of a 4-bit full adder circuit. It includes functions for XOR gate, half adder, full adder, converting integers to binary bus, and testing the full adder functionality. The main function runs a test to ensure the full adder works correctly with 4-bit inputs. This code can be used to simulate and test the behavior of a 4-bit full adder circuit.
