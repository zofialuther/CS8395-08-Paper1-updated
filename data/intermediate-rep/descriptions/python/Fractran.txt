This Python code uses the fractran library to generate prime numbers from a fractional programming language. It iterates through the fractran series and checks if the binary representation of the number has exactly one '1' and multiple '0's, which indicates that it is a prime number. The code then yields the prime number along with its position in the series. In the main block, it prints the prime numbers generated along with their corresponding positions in the fractran series.
