This Python code defines a function for right-to-left function composition and a generic zipWith function. The main function demonstrates the use of these functions by creating a list of composed functions and applying them to the value 0.5. The output is the result of applying sine, cosine, and a cubing function to 0.5, followed by taking the arcsine, arccosine, and the 1/3 power of 0.5.
