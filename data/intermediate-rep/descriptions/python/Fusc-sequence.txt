This Python code defines functions to generate the Fusc sequence, which is a sequence of integers. The `infiniteFusc` function generates an infinite stream of Fusc sequence terms, while the `fusc` function calculates the Fusc sequence for a given integer. The `firstFuscOfEachMagnitude` function generates a non-finite stream of each term in the Fusc sequence that requires an unprecedented quantity of decimal digits. The `main` function tests the other functions by printing the first 61 terms of the Fusc sequence and the first term of each decimal magnitude. The code also includes generic functions for list manipulation, such as `iterate`, `showList`, and `take`. When run, the `main` function is executed to test the Fusc sequence functions.
