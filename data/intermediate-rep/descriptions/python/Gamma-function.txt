This code defines the gamma function, which is a mathematical function used to extend the factorial function to non-integer values. It uses a table of precomputed values to calculate the gamma function for a given input. The code includes a main function that demonstrates the gamma function over a range of values and also includes generic functions for formatting and enumerating integers. The code is well-structured and includes comments to explain the purpose of each function.
