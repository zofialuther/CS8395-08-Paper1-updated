This code is a Python program that implements the classic FizzBuzz problem. It takes an integer input 'n' and a list of tuples 'mods' containing divisor and corresponding string values. It then generates the FizzBuzz sequence up to 'n' using the specified divisors and strings. The program uses a defaultdict to store the results and then constructs the FizzBuzz sequence by iterating through the divisors and adding the corresponding strings to the results. Finally, it prints the resulting FizzBuzz sequence. Additionally, the program can take user input for 'n' and custom divisors and strings to generate a customized FizzBuzz sequence.
