This Python code uses the bisect module to create a guessing game for a number between 0 and 100. It defines a class called GuessNumberFakeList that simulates a list and prompts the user to indicate if their number is less than or equal to a specific value. The bisect.bisect_left function is then used to guess the user's number and print the result. It also includes instructions for the user on how to play the game.
