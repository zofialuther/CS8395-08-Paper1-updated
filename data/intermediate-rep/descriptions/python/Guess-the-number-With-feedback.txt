This code is a simple guessing game where the user is asked to guess a target number within a specified range. The program generates a random target number within the specified range and then prompts the user to input their guess. If the guess is not within the specified range or is not a valid number, the program will prompt the user to try again. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program will display a message and prompt the user to play again.
