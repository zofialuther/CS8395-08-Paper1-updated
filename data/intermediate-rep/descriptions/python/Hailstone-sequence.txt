This code defines a generator function called hailstone, which generates a sequence of numbers based on a specific rule. It starts with a given number and then applies a series of mathematical operations to produce a sequence of numbers. The code then tests the hailstone function by generating sequences for specific numbers and checking the results against expected values. Finally, it finds the number with the maximum length of the hailstone sequence for numbers less than 100,000 and prints the result.
