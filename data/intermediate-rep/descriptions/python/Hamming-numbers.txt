This Python code defines a generator function called "hamming_numbers" that yields a sequence of numbers known as Hamming numbers. These numbers are positive integers that have no prime factors other than 2, 3, or 5. The function uses the "tee" function from the "itertools" module to create three independent iterators from the original generator. It then uses the "merge" function from the "heapq" module to merge the three iterators into a single sorted sequence of numbers. The function yields each unique number in the sequence, ensuring that each number is only yielded once.
