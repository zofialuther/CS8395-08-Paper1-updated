This Python code defines a happyNumbers generator that produces a non-finite stream of happy numbers. A happy number is a number that, when replaced by the sum of the squares of its digits, and the process repeated, eventually reaches 1. The code includes functions for checking if a number is happy, for generating a sequence of happy numbers, as well as utility functions for working with sequences and integers. When run, it prints the first 8 happy numbers.
