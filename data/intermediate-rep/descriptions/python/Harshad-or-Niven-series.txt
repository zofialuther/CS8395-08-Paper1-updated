This code uses the itertools library to generate and print a list of Harshad numbers. Harshad numbers are numbers that are divisible by the sum of their digits. The code defines a function called harshad which uses itertools.count to generate an infinite sequence of Harshad numbers. The list() function is used to get the first 20 Harshad numbers from the sequence. Additionally, there is a loop that prints the first Harshad number greater than 1000 and then breaks the loop.
