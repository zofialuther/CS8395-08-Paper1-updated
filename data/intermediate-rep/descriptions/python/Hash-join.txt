This code implements a hash join function that takes in two tables and their corresponding indices and performs a hash join operation on them. The function first creates a defaultdict to store the hash table and then goes through the first table to hash the values based on the specified index. It then performs the join phase by iterating through the second table and retrieving the matching values from the hash table. The result is a list of tuples representing the joined rows. The code includes example tables and a loop to print the results of the hash join operation.
