This code is a simple Kivy application that creates a "Goodbye" button on a float layout. When the button is pressed, a custom popup window is opened with the title "Goodbye, World!" and a label displaying the text "Goodbye, World!" The popup has a size_hint of (0.75, 0.75) and an opacity of 0.8. The code defines a Kivy app called GoodByeApp and uses a Builder to load the defined kv string. When the app is run, it displays the float layout with the "Goodbye" button, and when pressed, it opens the custom popup window.
