This code sets up a simple HTTP server using Python's built-in `http.server` module and `threading` for handling multiple requests simultaneously. The server responds to GET requests with a "Hello World! 今日は" message encoded in UTF-8. The `serve` function creates a `ThreadingHTTPServer` instance and starts it to listen on the localhost at port 80. A separate thread is used to run the server, allowing the main thread to listen for user input and handle Ctrl+C to gracefully stop the server.
