This Python code defines two functions, ff_R and ff_S, which generate sequences of numbers based on the values in lists cR and cS. The extend_RS function is used to extend the lists cR and cS. The code then runs tests on the ff_R and ff_S functions to generate sequences of numbers and performs some operations on the generated sequences. Finally, the code prints "Ok" if it reaches the end without encountering any errors.
