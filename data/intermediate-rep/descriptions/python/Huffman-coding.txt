This Python code provides functionality for Huffman encoding and decoding. It includes classes and functions for building a Huffman tree from symbol frequencies, encoding byte strings using Huffman coding, decoding byte streams using a Huffman tree, and generating a stream of bits from file-like objects and iterable byte strings. The main function demonstrates an example usage of the Huffman encoding and decoding functions. The code is compatible with Python version 3.7 and above.
