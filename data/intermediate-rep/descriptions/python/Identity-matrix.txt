This code defines a function called identity that takes a size parameter. It creates a square matrix of the given size and sets the diagonal elements to 1 while keeping the rest of the elements as 0. The function then prints the matrix row by row, with each row separated by a new line. The code uses list comprehension to efficiently create the matrix and avoids a common flaw in creating a list of lists in Python.
