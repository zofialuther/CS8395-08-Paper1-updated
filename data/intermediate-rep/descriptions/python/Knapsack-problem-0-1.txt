This code is a knapsack problem solver that takes a list of items with their weights and values, as well as a maximum weight constraint. It uses a dynamic programming approach to find the optimal combination of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the maximum weight. The "solve" function uses memoization to store subproblem solutions and avoid redundant calculations. The final solution is then printed, including the selected items, their total value, and their total weight.
