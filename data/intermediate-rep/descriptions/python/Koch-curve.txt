The given code uses Python to generate a Koch snowflake of order 4 in SVG format. It defines functions for creating a Koch curve and equilateral apex, as well as for rotating points and vectors. The main function generates the SVG for the Koch snowflake, using the points calculated from the kochSnowflake function. The code demonstrates the use of functional programming techniques, mathematical calculations, and SVG generation to create a visual representation of the Koch snowflake.
