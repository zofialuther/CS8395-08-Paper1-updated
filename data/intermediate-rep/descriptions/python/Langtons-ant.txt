This code implements Langton's ant, a cellular automaton that simulates an ant moving on a grid of cells. The ant follows simple rules based on the color of the cell it is on, and its movement causes patterns to emerge. The code defines the possible directions and colors, as well as functions to invert the color of a cell, compute the next direction and position of the ant, and display the grid. The main function initializes the grid, sets the starting position and direction of the ant, and then iterates through a specified number of steps while displaying the grid at each step.
