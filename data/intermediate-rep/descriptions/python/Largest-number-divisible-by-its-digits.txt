This Python program finds the largest number that is divisible by its own digits. It first generates a list of digits excluding 0 and 5, then calculates the least common multiple of these digits. The program then creates permutations of 7 digits, including any two of [1, 4, 7], and finds the maximum number that is divisible by its digits and also by the least common multiple of the digits. The main function runs these calculations and prints the result. The program also includes generic functions for concatenating mapped lists, deleting elements from a list, and calculating the least common multiple of two integers.
