This code provides the implementation of the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) functions in Python. It includes functions for calculating LCM, GCD, and also includes test cases. Additionally, it contains generic functions for working with tuples and lists, as well as formatting functions for tabular output. The main function runs the test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the LCM and GCD functions.
