This Python code implements long multiplication using a combination of map, reduce, and lambda functions. It takes two numbers as input and then uses the polymul and mult_table functions to perform the multiplication. The digits function is used to convert the input numbers into lists of their individual digits. The longmult function then calculates the product of the two numbers using the polymul and digitSum functions. Finally, the code prints the result of multiplying 2^64 by 2^64.
