This Python code includes two functions: "sieve" and "findPeriod." The "sieve" function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit. The "findPeriod" function calculates the period of the reciprocal of a given number.

After defining these functions, the code calls the "sieve" function to generate a list of prime numbers up to 64,000. It then iterates through these prime numbers, using the "findPeriod" function to identify those that have a period equal to the prime number minus 1.

Next, the code creates a list of specific numbers (500, 1000, 2000, etc.) and counts the number of long primes (defined as those with a period equal to the prime number minus 1) up to each of these numbers.

Finally, the code prints the long primes up to 500 and the number of long primes up to each of the specified numbers (500, 1000, etc.).
