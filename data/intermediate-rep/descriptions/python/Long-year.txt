This Python code defines a function `longYear` that takes a year as input and returns True if that year has 53 weeks according to the ISO calendar. The `main` function then prints a list of longer (53 week) years in the range from 2000 to 2100. The code uses the `datetime` module to calculate the number of weeks in each year and demonstrates the use of list comprehensions and conditional statements in Python.
