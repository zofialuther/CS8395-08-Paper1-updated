The code defines a function called longest_increasing_subsequence that takes a list d as input and returns one of the longest increasing subsequences of the input list. The function uses dynamic programming to find the longest increasing subsequence and then returns the maximum length subsequence. The main part of the code then tests the function with two example input lists and prints the longest increasing subsequence for each input.
