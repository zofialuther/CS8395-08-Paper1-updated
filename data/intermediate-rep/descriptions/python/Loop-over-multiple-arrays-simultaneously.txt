This code uses the `zip` function to combine corresponding elements from the three provided strings 'abc', 'ABC', and '123'. The `map` function is then used to join each set of combined elements into a single string. The `print` function then prints each joined string on a separate line. The output displays the combined elements of the three strings in the format of "lowercase + uppercase + number".
