This code imports the `stdout` module from the `sys` library and assigns the `stdout.write` function to the variable `write`. It then sets the variables `n` and `i` to 10 and 1, respectively. It enters a while loop that writes the value of `i` to the standard output, increments `i` by 1, and adds a comma and space after the value. This process continues until `i` reaches 10, at which point the loop breaks. The result is the numbers 1 through 10 separated by commas and spaces.
