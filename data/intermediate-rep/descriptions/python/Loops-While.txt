This code initializes a variable `n` with the value 1024 and then enters a while loop. Within the loop, it prints the current value of `n` and then divides it by 2 using the floor division operator `//`. This process continues until `n` is no longer greater than 0. The code effectively prints a sequence of numbers starting with 1024 and continuously halving the value until it reaches 0.
