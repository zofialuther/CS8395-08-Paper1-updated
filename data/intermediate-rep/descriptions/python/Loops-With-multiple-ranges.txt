This Python code uses the itertools module to create a range function and then calculates the product and sum of a series of numbers. The code initializes variables for product, sum, and various numbers. It then defines a custom range function that takes three parameters and includes a conditional statement to handle negative steps. The code then uses the custom range function to generate lists of numbers and calculates the sum and product of the absolute values of those numbers. Finally, it prints the sum and product.
