This code defines a function called ludic that generates Ludic numbers up to a specified maximum value. It then uses list comprehension to generate a list of Ludic primes and prints the first 25 Ludic primes, the count of Ludic numbers less than or equal to 1000, and the 2000th to 2005th Ludic primes. It also creates a list of triplets of Ludic primes that are less than a specified value and prints the count and the list of triplets.
