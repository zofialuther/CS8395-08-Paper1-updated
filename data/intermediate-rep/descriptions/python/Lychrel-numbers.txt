This code is a Python program that calculates Lychrel numbers and related values using a reverse-digits-and-adds process. It defines functions for adding the reverse of a number, splitting roots from related numbers, and finding Lychrel numbers within a given range and under a specified limit of reversions. The main part of the code runs these calculations and outputs the number of Lychrel numbers, the Lychrel numbers themselves, the number of related Lychrel numbers, and the Lychrel palindromes. The code uses a future import statement for print function compatibility.
