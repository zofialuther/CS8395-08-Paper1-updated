The given code defines a function called "transpose" that takes a matrix as input and returns its transposed matrix. The transposition is done without changing the type of the matrix. The code then demonstrates the transposition of four basic types of Python matrices: tuple of tuples, tuple of lists, list of lists, and list of tuples. It also handles cases where the input matrix is empty. The code prints the original matrix and its transposed matrix for each type of input, including the type of the matrices.
