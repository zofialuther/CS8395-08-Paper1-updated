This code is a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The code takes a graph and a source node as input and returns the shortest distances and the previous nodes in the optimal path from the source. It also includes a function to display the optimal path based on the predecessor nodes. The algorithm uses a priority queue to efficiently find the node with the smallest distance, and iteratively updates the distances and predecessors to find the optimal path. The code includes a sample graph and demonstrates the use of the Dijkstra function to find the shortest path from a specified source node.
