This code uses the pandas library to load and manipulate data from csv files. It first loads patient and visit data from csv files, then demonstrates how to create data frames with hard-coded data. The code then typecasts the visit date from string to datetime and merges the patient and visit data on the patient ID. It uses the groupby function to group the data and then aggregates the grouped data to find the maximum visit date and calculate the sum and mean of the visit scores for each patient. Finally, it prints the resulting data frame.
