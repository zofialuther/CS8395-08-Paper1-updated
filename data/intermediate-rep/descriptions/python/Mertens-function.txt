This Python code defines a function called "mertens" that generates Mertens numbers up to a specified count. The Mertens numbers are calculated using a specific algorithm and stored in a list. The function then returns the list of Mertens numbers. The code then uses the "mertens" function to generate the first 99 Mertens numbers and prints them out in a formatted manner. Additionally, the code calculates and prints the number of times the Mertens function equals zero and the number of times it crosses zero.
