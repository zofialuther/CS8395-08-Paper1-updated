This Python code defines a function called `mid3digits` that takes an integer as input and returns either the middle three digits of the absolute value of the input number or an explanatory string if the input does not meet certain conditions. The code also includes a test function and some generic utility functions for working with either types and function composition. The test function demonstrates the use of the `mid3digits` function with various input values.
