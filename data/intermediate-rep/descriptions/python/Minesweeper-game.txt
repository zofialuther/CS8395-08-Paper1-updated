This code is for a Minesweeper game. It creates a grid with a random number of hidden mines that need to be found. The player can toggle where they think a mine is located, clear the grid starting at a specific position, print the grid so far, or resign. The game continues until the player has correctly identified all the mines or resigns. The code uses recursion to clear adjacent free points and displays the number of adjacent true mines in the immediate neighborhood. The player wins if they correctly identify all the mines.
