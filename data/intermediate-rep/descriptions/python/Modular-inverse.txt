This code is a Python implementation of various generic abstractions and functions related to modular arithmetic. It includes functions such as modInv, gcdExt, enumFromTo, bindMay, Just, mapMaybe, maybe, and others. The main function demonstrates the use of modInv to find modular inverses for a given number within a specific range. The code also includes type definitions for Maybe and functions for handling Maybe values. Overall, the code provides a set of tools for working with modular arithmetic and handling optional values in a functional programming style.
