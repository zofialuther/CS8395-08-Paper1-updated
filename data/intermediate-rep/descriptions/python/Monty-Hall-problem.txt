This Python code simulates the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle that involves selecting one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The code allows for the option to switch doors after one is revealed to be empty. It sets up the doors, runs the simulation for a specified number of iterations, and then prints the results of both switching and not switching. The code includes references to external sources for further information on the Monty Hall problem.
