This Python code generates a multiplication table of a given dimension using both list comprehension and the list monad. The multiplication table is created without redundant entries beneath the diagonal of squares. The code includes functions for generating the table, as well as generic functions for working with lists. The main function tests the two different methods of generating the multiplication table and displays the results.
