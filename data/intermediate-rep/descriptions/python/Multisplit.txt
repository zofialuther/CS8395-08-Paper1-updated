The code defines a function called multisplit that takes in a text and a list of separators. It iterates through the text and splits it at each occurrence of the specified separators, replacing the separator with a tuple indicating which separator was found and at what index. The function then returns a list of the split segments and the tuples indicating the separators and their positions in the original text. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the function's functionality with different orders of separators.
