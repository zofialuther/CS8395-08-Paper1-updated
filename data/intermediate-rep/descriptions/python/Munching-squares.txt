This Python code uses the Image and ImageDraw modules to create a new 256x256 pixel RGB image. It then uses a nested loop to iterate through each pixel in the image and apply a color based on the XOR operation between the x and y coordinates. The resulting image is then saved as "xorpic.png" in the PNG format.
