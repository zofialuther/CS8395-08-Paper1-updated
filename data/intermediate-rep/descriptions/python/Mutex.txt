This Python code creates a multi-threaded program that simulates the use of a limited number of resources using a semaphore. The program defines a Semaphore with a maximum of 2 resources and creates a thread class that represents a worker that needs to acquire and release resources. The threads will attempt to acquire a resource, work for 2 seconds, and then release the resource back to the pool. If all resources are occupied, the threads will block and wait until a resource becomes available. The program then creates 4 instances of the thread class and starts them, allowing them to compete for the limited resources.
