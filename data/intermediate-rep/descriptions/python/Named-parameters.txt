This code defines a function called show_args that takes in default parameters, positional arguments, and keyword arguments. The function then prints out the values of these parameters and arguments in a structured format. The code includes multiple examples of calling the show_args function with different combinations of parameters and arguments to demonstrate its functionality. The code also includes a comment explaining a syntax error that occurs when positional arguments are placed after keyword arguments.
