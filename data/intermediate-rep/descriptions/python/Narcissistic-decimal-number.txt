This code defines a function called "narcissists" that generates narcissistic numbers. A narcissistic number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number. The code uses a nested loop to iterate through each possible number and check if it is a narcissistic number. It then prints the first 25 narcissistic numbers in sets of 5. The code uses the "itertools" module to generate the numbers and the "future" module to ensure compatibility with Python 3's print function.
