This Python code is a solver for a nonogram puzzle, which is a logic puzzle in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. The code uses a combination of pattern generation and exhaustive search to deduce and solve the puzzle, and can determine whether the solution is unique or not. It takes input in the form of horizontal and vertical runs of the nonogram puzzle and then proceeds to solve the puzzle.
