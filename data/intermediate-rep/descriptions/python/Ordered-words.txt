This code uses the urllib library to access a word list from a URL. It then reads the content, decodes it, and splits it into individual words. It then checks if each word is equal to its sorted version, and if so, adds it to a list. Next, it finds the length of the longest word in the list of ordered words and creates a new list containing only words of that length. Finally, it prints out the longest ordered words found in the original word list.
