This code takes a user-input sentence and checks if it is a pangram, meaning it contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. It first checks the version of Python being used and then defines a function called ispangram. This function takes a sentence and an alphabet as input, and then checks if the set of the alphabet is a subset of the set of the sentence when both are converted to lowercase. Finally, it prompts the user to enter a sentence and then prints out the result of the ispangram function for that sentence.
