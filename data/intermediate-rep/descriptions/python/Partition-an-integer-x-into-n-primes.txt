This code uses Python's itertools module to generate combinations of prime numbers based on a given input. It includes a function to check if a number is prime, generate a list of prime numbers up to a specified value, and then uses combinations to find a set of prime numbers that add up to a given sum. The code then prints the combinations that add up to the sum and indicates if no combination is possible.
