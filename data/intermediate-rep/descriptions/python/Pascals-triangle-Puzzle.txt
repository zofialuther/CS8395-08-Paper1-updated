This code defines a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) using the 'csp' library. It creates a problem with variables R2, R3, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, X, Y, and Z, each with a range of 0 to 151. The code then adds rules and constraints to the problem, such as defining the relationships between the variables using arithmetic operations. Finally, it iterates through the possible solutions and prints the values of the variables X, Y, and Z that satisfy the constraints.
