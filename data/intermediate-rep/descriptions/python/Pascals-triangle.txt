This Python function, pascal(), takes an integer n as input and prints out n rows of Pascal's triangle. It uses a list called row to store the values of each row and a list called k to keep track of the previous row. The function then iterates through the range of n, generating the values for each row and printing them out. Finally, the function returns True if it successfully printed the rows of Pascal's triangle, and False if it failed to do so.
