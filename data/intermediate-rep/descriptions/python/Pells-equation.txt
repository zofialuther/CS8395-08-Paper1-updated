This Python code defines a function called solvePell that uses the Pell equation to find solutions for the equation x^2 - ny^2 = 1. The code uses a while loop to iterate through the calculations and return the values of x and y for specific values of n (61, 109, 181, and 277). The math module is imported to use the square root function. The code demonstrates the use of the Pell equation to find integer solutions for certain values of n.
