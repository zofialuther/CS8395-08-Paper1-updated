This Python code simulates a game of coin tossing between two players. The program randomly selects which player goes first and then prompts the user to input a sequence of three heads or tails. The program then generates a sequence of heads and tails, checking for a match with the user's input. Once a match is found, the program declares the winner with a dramatic effect by adding a one-second delay between each coin toss.
