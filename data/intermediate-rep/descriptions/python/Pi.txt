This Python code is a generator function that calculates the digits of the mathematical constant pi using the Gauss-Legendre algorithm. It iteratively yields the digits of pi using the algorithm and prints them in groups of 40 digits until a specified number of digits is reached. The algorithm involves a while loop with multiple variables to efficiently calculate the digits of pi.
