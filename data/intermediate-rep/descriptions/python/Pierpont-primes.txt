This Python code includes a Miller-Rabin primality test function and a function to generate Pierpont primes of the first and second kind. The main function prints the first 50 Pierpont primes of each kind and the 250th Pierpont prime of each kind. Pierpont primes are a type of prime number related to the Pierpont function, and this code uses the is_Prime function to determine whether a number is prime.
