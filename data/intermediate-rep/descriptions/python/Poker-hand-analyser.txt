This Python code defines a set of functions that evaluate poker hands and determine their rank based on standard poker rules. The code uses the namedtuple class from the collections module to represent a playing card, and then implements functions to check for various poker hands such as straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and high card. The rank function is used to rank a given set of cards, and the handy function is used to parse and validate a set of cards. Finally, the code includes a main section that demonstrates the use of the rank function to evaluate and rank a series of example poker hands.
