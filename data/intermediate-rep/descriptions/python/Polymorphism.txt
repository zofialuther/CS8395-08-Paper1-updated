This code defines two classes, Point and Circle. The Point class represents a point in 2D space with x and y coordinates, and the Circle class represents a circle with a center point and a radius. The Point class has a constructor to initialize the x and y coordinates, as well as a method to return a string representation of the point. The Circle class has a constructor to initialize the center point and radius, as well as a method to return a string representation of the circle. If no center point is provided when creating a circle, it defaults to the origin (0, 0).
