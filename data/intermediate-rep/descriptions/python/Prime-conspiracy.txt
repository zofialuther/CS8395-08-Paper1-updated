This Python code defines a function to check if a number is a prime number and another function to generate prime numbers. It then uses these functions to generate a list of prime numbers and calculate the frequency of transitions between the last digit of one prime number and the last digit of the next prime number. The code then prints the results, showing the frequency of these transitions.
