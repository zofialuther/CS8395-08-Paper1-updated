This Python code includes functions to find the proper divisors of a number, count the number of proper divisors, and format and display the results. The showcount function uses the pdc function to find the number up to a given limit with the highest number of proper divisors and displays the results using the fmtres function. The code also includes a loop to demonstrate the proper divisors of numbers up to a given limit and uses the showcount function to display the number up to and including the limit with the highest and lowest number of proper divisors. Finally, it calls the showcount function for the limits of 20,000 and 25,000.
