This code demonstrates the implementation and manipulation of quaternion numbers. It includes operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and normalization of quaternions. Additionally, it shows the use of quaternions to represent and perform operations related to the imaginary units i, j, and k. The code also showcases the concept of conjugate, reciprocal, and the assertion of non-commutativity for certain operations involving quaternions.
