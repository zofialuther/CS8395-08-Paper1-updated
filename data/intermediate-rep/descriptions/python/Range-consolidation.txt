This code defines two functions, `normalize` and `consolidate`, which work together to sort and consolidate overlapping ranges. The `normalize` function sorts the ranges in a list of lists, while the `consolidate` function then consolidates any overlapping or intersecting ranges into a single range. The code also includes a test block using different sets of ranges and prints the original ranges and the consolidated ranges to demonstrate how the functions work.
