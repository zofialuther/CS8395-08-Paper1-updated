This code defines a function called rangeexpand that takes a string of comma-separated range values and expands them into a list of individual numbers. The function uses regular expressions to parse the input string and then iterates through each range, adding the individual numbers to a list. If a range is specified (e.g. "1-5"), the function uses the xrange function to generate the range of numbers. If only a single number is given, it is added directly to the list. Finally, the function returns the list of expanded numbers.
