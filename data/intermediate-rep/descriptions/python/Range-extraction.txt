This code defines a function called range_extract that takes a sorted iterable as input and returns an iterator of range tuples. The function iterates through the input iterable and identifies consecutive numbers in a sequence. It then yields range tuples for those consecutive numbers, or single number tuples if there are gaps in the sequence. The printr function is used to print the range tuples in a specific format. The main part of the code demonstrates how the range_extract function can be used to extract ranges from two example lists and print the results using the printr function.
