This Python code encodes integers into Roman numerals. The main function takes a list of integers and converts them into Roman numeral strings using the romanFromInt function. The romanFromInt function uses a combination of mapAccumL and concat to convert the integer into its Roman numeral representation. The mapAccumL function performs a combined map and fold operation with accumulation from left to right. Finally, the snd function is used to access the second component of a tuple. The code demonstrates the conversion of several years into their Roman numeral representations as a sample.
