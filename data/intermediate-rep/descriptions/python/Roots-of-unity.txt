This Python code defines a class called Complex, which extends the built-in complex class. The class has methods to check if the complex number is purely imaginary or purely real, and to represent the complex number as a string. It also contains a function called croots that calculates the nth roots of unity using complex numbers. The code then loops through numbers from 2 to 10 and prints the list of complex roots for each number.
