This Python code implements a rot-13 encoding method, which shifts each letter 13 places down the alphabet. The program takes input from the command line or acts as a standard UNIX filter if no arguments are specified. It then encodes the input line by line using the rot-13 method and prints the encoded text. The code uses the string and fileinput libraries to handle the input and output.
