The given code contains two functions, `encode` and `decode`, that are used for encoding and decoding strings using a specific algorithm. The `encode` function takes a text input and compresses consecutive characters by replacing them with the number of times they appear followed by the character itself. The `decode` function does the opposite by expanding the compressed text back to its original form. The code also includes doctests to demonstrate the functionality of both functions. Additionally, it includes an assertion to ensure that the output of the `decode` function applied to the result of the `encode` function on a given text input is equal to the original input.
