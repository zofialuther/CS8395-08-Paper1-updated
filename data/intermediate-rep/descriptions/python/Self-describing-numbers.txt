This code defines a function called isSelfDescribing that takes a number as input and checks if the number is self-describing. A self-describing number is a number that describes itself in terms of the count of each digit it contains. The code then generates a list of self-describing numbers within the range of 0 to 4000000 and returns the result. Additionally, it provides a list of tuples containing the self-describing numbers and their corresponding boolean values indicating whether they are self-describing or not.
