This Python code generates a plain text ASCII code table, arranged in 16 rows and 6 columns. It includes functions for creating the table, formatting ASCII entries, and displaying the table. The code uses various generic abstractions for working with lists, such as chunking, concatenation, enumeration, and transposition. The main function tests the code by printing the ASCII table.
