This code defines a function called sierpinski_carpet that takes an integer n as input. The function generates a Sierpinski carpet pattern of size n and returns it as a string. The pattern is created using a recursive algorithm that iteratively adds layers to the carpet, with each layer being a combination of the previous layers. The final carpet is printed to the console using the print statement.
