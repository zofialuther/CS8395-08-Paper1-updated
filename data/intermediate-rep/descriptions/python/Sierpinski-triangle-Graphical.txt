This Python code is a complicated version that uses the numpy and turtle modules to define functions for drawing actions. The functions Left, Right, and Forward are used by the main function DrawSierpinskiTriangle to control the movement of the turtle in creating a Sierpinski triangle. The code starts with importing necessary modules and then defines the drawing actions using the turtle module.
