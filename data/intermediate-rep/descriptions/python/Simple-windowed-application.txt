This code creates a simple GUI application using the tkinter library in Python. The application consists of a window with a label and a button. When the button is clicked, the number of clicks is incremented and displayed in the label. The number of clicks is stored in a tk.IntVar variable. The function `on_click` updates the counter and label text when the button is clicked. The `functools.partial` function is used to create a new function `update_counter` with pre-set arguments for the `on_click` function. The `main` function sets up the window, label, button, and event handling, and starts the GUI event loop.
