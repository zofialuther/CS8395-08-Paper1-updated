This Python code defines a function called disjointSort that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with a disjoint sublist of items at specified indexes sorted in numeric or lexical order. The main function demonstrates the use of disjointSort by sorting a disjoint sublist at indices [6, 1, 7] in two different lists: [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] and ['h', 'g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a']. The tabulated function is used to format and display the results.
