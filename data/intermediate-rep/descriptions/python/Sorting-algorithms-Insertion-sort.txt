This code defines a function called insertion_sort that takes a list L as input and sorts it in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm. The algorithm iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous ones and inserting it into the correct position. This is achieved by moving elements larger than the current one one position to the right until the correct position is found. Finally, the function returns the sorted list.
