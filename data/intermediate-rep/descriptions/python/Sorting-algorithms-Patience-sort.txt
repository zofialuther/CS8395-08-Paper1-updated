This code implements the patience sort algorithm, which is a sorting algorithm that uses a data structure called a "pile" to efficiently sort a list of numbers. The code defines a Pile class that inherits from the list class and implements the less than and equal to comparison methods. It then uses the bisect_left function to sort the input list into piles and merges them using a heap-based merge. Finally, it applies the patience sort algorithm to sort the input list and prints the sorted result.
