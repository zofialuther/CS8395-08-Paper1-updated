This code is an implementation of the quicksort algorithm, which is a popular sorting algorithm. The `quicksort` function is the entry point for the sorting process and it calls the `_quicksort` function with the array to be sorted and the indices of the first and last elements. The `_quicksort` function then recursively sorts the array by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array around the pivot, and then sorting the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot. This algorithm is known for its efficiency and is commonly used for sorting large datasets.
