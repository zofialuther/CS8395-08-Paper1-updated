This code is using the Soundex algorithm to convert the given words into their corresponding Soundex codes. The Soundex code is a phonetic algorithm that encodes words based on their pronunciation, allowing for easier comparison and matching of similar sounding words. The code is demonstrating the use of the soundex function to convert the words "soundex", "example", "ciondecks", and "ekzampul" into their respective Soundex codes: "S532", "E251", "C532", and "E251".
