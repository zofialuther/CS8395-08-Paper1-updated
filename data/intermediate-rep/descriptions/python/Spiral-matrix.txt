This Python code generates a two-dimensional array representing a spiral pattern of numbers. The 'spiral' function takes an integer 'n' as input and creates a square array of size 'n' filled with 'None' values. It then calculates the spiral pattern by populating the array with consecutive numbers in a spiral path. The resulting spiral array is printed row by row with each number formatted to occupy 3 spaces.
