This Python code uses the defaultdict module to create a map of pairs of states that can be combined to form an anagram. It first sorts the list of US states and then iterates through the list to create pairs of states and sort the letters in the combined names. It then prints out the pairs of states that have the same sorted letters, indicating they can be combined to form an anagram.
