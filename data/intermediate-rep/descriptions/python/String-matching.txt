This code demonstrates the usage of string methods in Python. It checks if the string "abcd" starts with "ab" and returns True. It also checks if "abcd" ends with "zn" and returns False. Then, it checks if "bb" is present in the string "abab" and returns False, while checking if "ab" is present in "abab" and returns True. The code also finds the position of "bb" in "abab" and returns -1, then finds the position of "ab" in "abab" and returns 0, and finally finds the position of "ab" in "abab" starting from the index after the first occurrence and returns 2.
