This code defines a function called test() that demonstrates the use of a commentstripper function. The test function first prints a non-nested block comment example, which includes a JavaScript code block with multiple comments. It then calls the commentstripper function to remove the comments and prints the result. After that, the test function prints a nested block comment example, followed by another call to the commentstripper function and printing the result. Finally, the code checks if the script is being run directly and if so, it calls the test function.
