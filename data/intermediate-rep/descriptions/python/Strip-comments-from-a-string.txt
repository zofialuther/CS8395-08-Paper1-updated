This Python code uses the itertools module to define a function called stripComments. This function takes a string of characters as input and returns a new function that can remove any comments (lines starting with one of the characters in the input string) from a given text. The code demonstrates how to use this function to remove comments from a multi-line string, using ';' and '#' as comment characters. When the code is run, it prints the result of the comment-stripped text.
