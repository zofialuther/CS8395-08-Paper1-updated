This Python code uses the sympy library to generate a series of successive prime numbers with specified differences between them. The main function, successive_primes, takes a set of offsets and a maximum prime number as input and returns a generator that yields groups of successive prime numbers meeting the specified criteria. The code then iterates through different combinations of offsets and maximum prime numbers to find sets of successive prime numbers and their counts. The results are printed to the console, showing the first and last groups of prime numbers, as well as the total count for each set.
