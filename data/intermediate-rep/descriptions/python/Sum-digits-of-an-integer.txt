This Python code defines a function called sumDigits that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number in a specified base. The function first checks if the base is at least 2 and returns an error message if it is not. Then it takes the absolute value of the input number and iteratively divides it by the base, summing the remainders. The function then returns the sum of the digits. The code includes several example calls to the sumDigits function with different input numbers and bases to demonstrate its functionality.
