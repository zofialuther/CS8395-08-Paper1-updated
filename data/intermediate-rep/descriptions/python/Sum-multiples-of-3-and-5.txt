This Python code defines three different functions - sum35a, sum35b, and sum35c - that calculate the sum of all numbers below a given input 'n' that are multiples of 3 or 5. The code then tests these functions for various values of 'n' and compares their outputs. It also prints the results for specific values of 'n' and demonstrates the scalability of the functions by testing them with a very large value of 'n'. The code showcases different ways to approach the same problem and provides a comparison of their results.
