This Python code defines two functions, seriesSumA and seriesSumB, which calculate the sum of a series by applying a given function over a list of values. The main function uses these two functions to sum the series 1/x^2 over x = 1 to 1000. The code also includes generic functions for function composition, integer enumeration, and creating a tabular string for displaying the results. The output of the main function is the sum of the series using both seriesSumA and seriesSumB.
