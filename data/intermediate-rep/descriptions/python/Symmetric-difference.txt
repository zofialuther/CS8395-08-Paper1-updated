This code creates two sets, setA and setB, containing names of individuals. It then performs various operations on these sets such as finding the symmetric difference, elements unique to each set, the union of both sets, and the intersection of both sets. The results are displayed as new sets containing the respective elements. This code demonstrates how to manipulate and compare sets in Python using different set operations.
