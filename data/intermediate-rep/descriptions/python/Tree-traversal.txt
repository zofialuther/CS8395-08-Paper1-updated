This code defines a Node class and its methods to perform various tree traversal operations such as preorder, inorder, postorder, and levelorder. It also includes a function to print the nodes of the tree with spaces in between. The main section of the code initializes a tree and calls the traversal methods to print the tree nodes in different orders.
