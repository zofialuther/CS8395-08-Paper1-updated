This Python code defines a function to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit, and another function to find the longest left and right truncatable prime numbers below a specified number. The code then prints the longest left and right truncatable prime numbers below one million. The `primes` function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently generate prime numbers, and the `truncatableprime` function checks for left and right truncatable primes using sets and string manipulation. The output is a pair of integers representing the longest left and right truncatable prime numbers below one million.
