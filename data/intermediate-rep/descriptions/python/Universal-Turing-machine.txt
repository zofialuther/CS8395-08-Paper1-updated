This code is a Python implementation of a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) that simulates the behavior of a Turing machine using a set of rules. It includes a function `run_utm` which takes parameters such as initial state, blank symbol, rules, tape configuration, halt state, and position. The code uses a while loop to simulate the Turing machine's behavior by applying the rules to the tape and transitioning between states. Additionally, the code includes examples of different UTM simulations, such as an increment machine, busy beaver, and a sorting test. These examples demonstrate how the `run_utm` function can be used to simulate different Turing machines with specific configurations and rules.
