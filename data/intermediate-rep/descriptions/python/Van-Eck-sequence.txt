This code defines a generator function called van_eck that produces the Van Eck sequence, a mathematical sequence where each new term is determined by the previous terms. The function uses a while loop and a dictionary to keep track of the values and their positions in the sequence. In the main block, it prints the first 10 terms of the Van Eck sequence and the 991st to 1000th terms of the sequence.
