This code snippet imports the Fraction class from the fractions module and then sets the default representation of Fraction objects to be displayed as a fraction in the format numerator/denominator. It then creates a list comprehension that uses the vdc function to generate a series of values in base 2, converting each value to a fraction. The resulting list contains the fractions representing the values from 0 to 9 in base 2.
