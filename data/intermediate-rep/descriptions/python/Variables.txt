This code demonstrates the assignment of different data types to variables. It starts by assigning the integer 3 to example1, the float 3.0 to example2, the boolean True to example3, and the string "hello" to example4. It then reassigns example1 to the string "goodbye". This code illustrates the flexibility of Python in allowing variables to be dynamically reassigned to different data types.
