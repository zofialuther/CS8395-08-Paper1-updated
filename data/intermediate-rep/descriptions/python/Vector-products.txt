This code contains functions for calculating the cross product, dot product, scalar triple product, and vector triple product of 3D vectors. The crossp function calculates the cross product of two 3D vectors, the dotp function calculates the dot product of two vectors of equal dimensions, the scalartriplep function calculates the scalar triple product of three vectors, and the vectortriplep function calculates the vector triple product of three vectors. The code also includes a main block that demonstrates the use of these functions with sample input vectors.
