This Python code generates a textually visualized tree with vertically-centered parent nodes. It provides the ability to draw the tree in both compact and expanded formats, with the option to prune out any lines containing no nodes. The code uses various functions to construct and manipulate the tree structure, and it includes a test section to showcase the drawing of trees in different formats. The tree drawing algorithm is inspired by a Haskell snippet.
