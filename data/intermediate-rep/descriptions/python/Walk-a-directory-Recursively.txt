This Python code uses the fnmatch module to search for files with the "*.mp3" extension within the root directory and its subdirectories. The print_fnmatches function takes a pattern, directory, and list of files as input and then prints the full path of any files that match the specified pattern. The os.path.walk function is then used to walk through the directory structure and call the print_fnmatches function for each directory, effectively searching for and printing the paths of all MP3 files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
