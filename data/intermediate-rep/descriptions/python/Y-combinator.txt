This code defines a higher-order function Y that takes as input another function f and returns a fixed point of f, allowing for the creation of recursive anonymous functions. It then demonstrates the use of Y to calculate the factorial and Fibonacci sequence for the first 10 numbers, using the fixed-point combinator to create recursive functions for these mathematical operations. The output is a list of the calculated values for each number in the range.
