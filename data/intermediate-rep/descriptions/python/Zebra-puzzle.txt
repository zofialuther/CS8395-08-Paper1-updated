This Python code utilizes the constraint module to solve a classic logic puzzle known as the Zebra Puzzle. The problem is to determine the nationality, color of house, brand of cigarette, pet, and drink for each of the five houses, based on a set of given clues and constraints. The code uses the addVariables function to define the variables and their possible values, then adds constraints to ensure that the values are exclusive within each category and satisfies the given clues. Finally, it retrieves the solution and prints the answers in a tabular format.
