The code defines a function called "zigzag" that generates a zigzag pattern of numbers in a square grid based on the input parameter "n." It then defines a function called "printzz" to display the zigzag pattern as lines. The "printzz" function takes the output of the "zigzag" function and prints the zigzag pattern in a visually understandable format. Finally, the code prints the zigzag pattern for the input value of 6.
