1. Import necessary libraries
2. Define Expr data type with two constructors
3. Define function toDoc that takes an Expr and returns a Doc
4. Define a list ops of tuples containing operators and corresponding functions
5. Define a function solve that takes an Int and a list of Ints and returns a list of Expr
6. Inside solve, define a function genAst that takes a list of Ints and returns a list of Expr
7. Inside solve, define a function eval that takes an Expr and returns a Maybe Int
8. Define a function select that takes an Int and a list of Ints and returns a list of lists of Ints
9. Define a function split that takes a list of Ints and returns a list of tuples of two lists of Ints
10. Define a main function that uses mapM_ to print the result of toDoc for each Expr returned from solve 24 [2,3,8,9]
