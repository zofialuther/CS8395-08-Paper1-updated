1. Import the Data.Ratio module to use the (%) operator.

2. Define the main function to print the first N perfect numbers.

3. Set the value of N to 4.

4. Use the mapM_ function to print each element in the list of perfect numbers.

5. Use the take function to get the first N elements from the list of perfect numbers.

6. Generate the list of perfect numbers using a list comprehension, where each candidate is checked for being a perfect number.

7. Define the getSum function to calculate the sum of the factors of a candidate number.

8. Calculate the sum of the factors using the formula 1 % candidate + sum of (1 % factor + 1 % (candidate `div` factor)) for each factor in the range 2 to the square root of the candidate number.

9. The candidate number must also satisfy the condition that the modulo of candidate and factor is equal to 0.

10. End of the pseudocode.
