1. Start
2. Define a function Math.Statistics.median that takes an array of numbers as input
3. Sort the input array in ascending order
4. Calculate the length of the input array and store it in a variable n
5. If the length of the input array is odd
    6. Return the middle element of the sorted array as the median
7. If the length of the input array is even
    8. Return the average of the two middle elements of the sorted array as the median
9. End
