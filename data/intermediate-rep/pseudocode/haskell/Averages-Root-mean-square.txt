1. Define a function rootMeanSquare that takes a list of Doubles and returns a Double
2. Set rootMeanSquare to be equal to the square root of the result of the following function:
3.   a. Use the foldr function to apply the following steps to the list of Doubles:
4.       i. Add the square of each Double to the accumulator (starting at 0)
5.     b. Divide the result of the foldr function by the genericLength of the original list
6. Define the main function that takes no input and returns IO ()
7. Set the main function to print the result of calling rootMeanSquare with the list [1 .. 10]
