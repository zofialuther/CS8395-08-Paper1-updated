1. Initialize bellTri as a list of lists of integers.

2. Define a function f that takes a list of integers xs and returns a tuple of the last element of xs and xs.

3. Use the map function to apply the snd function to the result of iterating the function f composed with the uncurry function applied to scanl (+) over the initial tuple (1, [1]).

4. Define bell as a list of integers by applying the head function to each element of bellTri.

5. Define the main function as an IO action.

6. Within the main function, print the message "First 10 rows of Bell's Triangle:".

7. Use the mapM_ function to print each of the first 10 elements of bellTri.

8. Print a newline character.

9. Print the message "First 15 Bell numbers:".

10. Use the mapM_ function to print each of the first 15 elements of bell.

11. Print a newline character.

12. Print the 50th element of bell.
