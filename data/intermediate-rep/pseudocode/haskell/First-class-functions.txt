```
FUNCTION cube(x)
    RETURN x ** 3.0

FUNCTION croot(x)
    RETURN x ** (1/3)

ARRAY funclist = [sin, cos, cube]

ARRAY invlist = [asin, acos, croot]

FUNCTION main()
    PRINT zipWith(\f, i -> f . i $ 0.5, funclist, invlist)
```
Note: This pseudocode assumes that the zipWith function is already defined in the language. If it is not, the implementation of zipWith would need to be included in the pseudocode.
