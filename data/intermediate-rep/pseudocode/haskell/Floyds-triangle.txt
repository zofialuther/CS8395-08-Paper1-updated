1. Set floyds as a 2D array of integers
2. Initialize floyds as an iteration of floyd with an initial value of [1]
3. Define floyd as a function that takes a list of integers as input
4. If the length of the input list is less than 2, return a list containing 1
5. Otherwise, calculate a range of numbers from (n * (n - 1)) / 2 to (n * (n + 1)) / 2, where n is the length of the input list
6. Define n as the length of the input list plus 1
7. Define the main function as an input-output function
8. For the first 5 values of floyds, print each value
9. Print an empty line
10. For the first 14 values of floyds, print each value.
