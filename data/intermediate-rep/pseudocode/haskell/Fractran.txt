```
1. Define a function called findIndex that takes two parameters: a list and a value
2. Inside the function, use the elemIndex function from Data.List to find the index of the value in the list
3. Use the mapMaybe function from Data.Maybe to remove any Nothing values from the result of elemIndex
4. Return the index of the value in the list
