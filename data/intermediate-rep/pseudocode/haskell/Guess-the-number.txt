1. Import the System.Random module
2. Define the main function
3. Call randomRIO (1,10) and pass the result to gameloop
4. Define the gameloop function that takes an Int as a parameter and returns an IO action
5. Inside gameloop, use a do block
6. Read a line from the input and convert it to an Int
7. Check if the input is equal to the random number
8. If it is, print "You got it!"
9. If it's not, print "Nope. Guess again." and call gameloop recursively with the same random number as the parameter.
