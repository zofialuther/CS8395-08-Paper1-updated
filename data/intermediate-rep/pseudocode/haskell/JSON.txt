1. Import necessary libraries
2. Define testdoc as an object with key-value pairs
3. Define main function
4. Encode testdoc using the encode function and store the result in a variable called out
5. Print out using B.putStrLn
6. Parse the encoded output using parseOnly and store the result in a variable called v
7. If the parsing fails, throw an error with the message "strange error re-parsing json: " followed by the error
8. If the parsing is successful and the parsed value is not equal to testdoc, throw an error with the message "documents not equal!"
9. If the parsing is successful and the parsed value is equal to testdoc, print the parsed value.
