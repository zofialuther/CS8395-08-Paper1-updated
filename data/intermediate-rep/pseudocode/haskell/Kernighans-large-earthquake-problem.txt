1. Import the Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 module as C
2. Define the main function of type IO ()
3. Within the main function:
   a. Read the contents of the file "data.txt" and store it in the variable cs using C.readFile
   b. Use mapM_ print to print the results of the following operations
   c. Split the contents of cs into lines using C.lines
   d. Use the >>= operator to chain the following operations
   e. For each line x, do the following:
      - Convert the line to a list of words using C.words
      - Convert the last word to a list of characters using C.unpack and then to a Float using read
      - Check if the Float value is greater than 6
      - If it is, add the line x to the list
   f. Print the resulting list of lines.
