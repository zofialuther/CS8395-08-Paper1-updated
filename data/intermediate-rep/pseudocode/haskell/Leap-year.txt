1. Import necessary modules
2. Define the function leaptext that takes in two parameters, x and b
3. If b is true, return the string representation of x followed by " is a leap year"
4. If b is false, return the string representation of x followed by " is not a leap year"
5. Define the function isleapsf that takes in one parameter, j
6. If j modulo 100 is equal to 0, check if j modulo 400 is equal to 0
7. If j modulo 100 is not equal to 0, check if j modulo 4 is equal to 0.
