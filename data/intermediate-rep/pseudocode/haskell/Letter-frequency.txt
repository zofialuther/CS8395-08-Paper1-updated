1. Import necessary libraries: Data.List, Data.Map.Strict, Data.Ord
2. Define the function charCounts that takes a String as input and returns a Map of Char to Int
3. In charCounts, use foldr to apply the alter function from Data.Map.Strict to each character in the input string and accumulate the counts in a Map
4. Define the alter function to increment the count of a character if it already exists in the Map, or set it to 1 if it doesn't
5. Define the main function that takes no arguments and returns an IO action
6. In main, read the contents of "miserables.txt" using readFile
7. Use the >>= operator to pass the contents to the next function
8. In the next function, mapM_ print the sorted list of tuples (character, count) by count in descending order
9. Use the sortBy function with comparing snd to sort the list by the second element of each tuple
10. Finally, convert the Map to a list of tuples using M.toList and apply the charCounts function to the contents of the file.
