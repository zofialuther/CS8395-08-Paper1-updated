1. Import the necessary modules: Data.Time.Calendar and Data.Time.Calendar.WeekDate.

2. Define a function longYear that takes an Integer as input and returns a Boolean.
   - Inside the function, use the fromGregorian function to get the date for December 28th of the input year.
   - Use the toWeekDate function to get the week number for December 28th of the input year.
   - Assign the week number to a variable w.
   - Return True if the week number is greater than 52, otherwise return False.

3. Define the main function of type IO ().
   - Use the mapM_ function to print the result of filtering the longYear function for the range of years from 2000 to 2100.
