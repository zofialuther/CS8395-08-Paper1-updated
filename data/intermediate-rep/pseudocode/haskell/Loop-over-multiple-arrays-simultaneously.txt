1. Set up the main function to be of type IO [()].
2. Within the main function, use the sequence function to execute a list of IO actions and gather their results.
3. Create a list comprehension to generate a list of IO actions that each print a combination of x, y, and z.
4. Use parallel list comprehension to iterate through the strings "abc", "ABC", and "123" simultaneously and generate combinations of x, y, and z.
5. For each combination, use the putStrLn function to print the combination of x, y, and z.
6. End the list comprehension and close the main function.
