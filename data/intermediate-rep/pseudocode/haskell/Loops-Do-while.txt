1. Set up the main function with IO type
2. Use the until function to iterate until a condition is met
3. The condition is defined as the first element of the list being greater than 0 and being divisible by 6
4. The function to apply to the list in each iteration is defined as adding 1 to the first element of the list
5. Start with a list containing 0
6. Reverse the resulting list
7. Print each element of the reversed list using mapM_ and the print function
