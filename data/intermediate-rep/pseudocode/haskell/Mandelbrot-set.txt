Pseudocode:

1. Define a function to iterate over a range of y values from 1 to -1 with a step of 0.02.
2. Within the function, iterate over a range of x values from -2 to 0.5 with a step of 0.02.
3. For each (x, y) pair, calculate the value of (a, b) using a folding function over a range of 500 iterations.
4. Check if the magnitude of (a, b) is less than 4. If it is, print '*' else print ' '.
5. Repeat the process for all (x, y) pairs and print the result.
