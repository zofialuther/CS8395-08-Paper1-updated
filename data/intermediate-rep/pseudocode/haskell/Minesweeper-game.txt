```
1. Define the necessary types: Pos, Board, CellState, and Cell.
2. Define the necessary lenses and prisms using Control.Lens library.
3. Define the totalRows and totalCols variables.
4. Implement the emptyBoard function to create an empty board with covered cells.
5. Implement the updateCell and updateBoard functions to update cells and the entire board.
6. Implement the openCell function to open a cell on the board.
7. Implement the expandEmptyCells function to handle the opening of adjacent empty cells.
8. Implement the flagCell function to flag/unflag a cell on the board.
9. Implement the adjacentCells function to find adjacent cells to a given cell.
10. Implement the isLoss, isWin, allUnMinedOpen, allMinesFlagged, and isFirstMove functions to check game conditions.
11. Implement the groupedByRows function to group cells by rows for display.
12. Implement the displayCell function to display a cell's state.
13. Implement the exposeMines function to expose all mined cells on the board.
14. Implement the updateMineCount function to update the count of adjacent mines for each cell.
15. Implement the mineBoard function to handle the placement of mines on the board.
