1. Import the Data.Modular library

2. Define a function f that takes a ℤ/13 as input and returns a ℤ/13 as output
   - Set the input as x
   - Calculate x^100 + x + 1
   - Return the result

3. Define the main function of type IO ()
   - Call the print function with the result of f when called with 10 as an argument.
