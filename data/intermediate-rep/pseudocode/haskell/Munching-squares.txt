1. Import the required modules:
   import qualified Data.ByteString as BY (writeFile, pack)
   import Data.Bits (xor)

2. Define the main function:
   main :: IO ()

3. Inside the main function, write the output to a file using ByteString.writeFile:
   BY.writeFile "out.pgm" (BY.pack (...))

4. Inside the ByteString.pack function, concatenate the following:
   - Convert the string "P5\n256 256\n256\n" to a list of bytes using fmap and fromEnum
   - Concatenate the result with the list comprehension for the pixel values

5. Inside the list comprehension, iterate over x from 0 to 255 and y from 0 to 255 and calculate the xor of x and y

6. Pseudocode:
   import qualified Data.ByteString as BY (writeFile, pack)
   import Data.Bits (xor)

   main :: IO ()
   main =
     BY.writeFile
       "out.pgm"
       (BY.pack
          (fmap (fromIntegral . fromEnum) "P5\n256 256\n256\n" ++
           [ x `xor` y
           | x <- [0 .. 255]
           , y <- [0 .. 255] ]))
