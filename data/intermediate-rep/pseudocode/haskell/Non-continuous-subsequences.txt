1. Define a function called disjoint that takes a list 'a' as input.
2. Use concatMap to iterate through the list of integers from 1 to the length of 'a' - 2.
3. For each element 'n' in the list of integers, define a function cutAt that takes a list 's' and an integer 'n' as input.
4. Inside cutAt, define 'left' and 'right' by splitting the list 's' at index 'n'.
5. Use delete to remove the empty list from the list of subsequences of 'right'.
6. Use init and tails to generate all possible combinations of 'a' and 'b'.
7. Concatenate the results of cutAt and return the final list of disjoint subsequences.
8. Define the main function to print the length of the result of disjoint function with input [1..20].
