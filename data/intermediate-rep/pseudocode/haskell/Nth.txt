1. Import Data.Array

2. Create a function called ordSuffs that returns an array of integers and strings
   2.1. Set ordSuffs as listArray (0,9) with the following values: ["th", "st", "nd", "rd", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th"]

3. Create a function called ordSuff that takes an integer n as input and returns a string
   3.1. Inside the function, concatenate the string representation of n with the result of the suff function with n as input
   3.2. Define the suff function that takes an integer m as input
      3.2.1. If (m `rem` 100) is greater than or equal to 11 and (m `rem` 100) is less than or equal to 13, return "th"
      3.2.2. Otherwise, return the value of ordSuffs at index (m `rem` 10)

4. Create a function called printOrdSuffs that takes a list of integers as input and returns an IO action
   4.1. Inside the function, apply the following operations:
      4.1.1. Convert the list of integers to a string using unwords
      4.1.2. Map the ordSuff function to the list of integers
      4.1.3. Call putStrLn with the result of the previous step as input

5. Create the main function as an IO action
   5.1. Inside the function, apply the following operations:
      5.1.1. Call printOrdSuffs with the list [0..25] as input
      5.1.2. Call printOrdSuffs with the list [250..265] as input
      5.1.3. Call printOrdSuffs with the list [1000..1025] as input
