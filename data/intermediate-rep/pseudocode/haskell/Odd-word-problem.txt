  Import necessary modules

  Define function split with input String and output (String, String)
    Set split to span isAlpha

  Define function parse with input String and output String
    If input String is empty
      Return empty string
    Else
      Set (a, w) to the result of split with input string
      Set (b, x) to the result of splitAt 1 with input w
      Set (c, y) to the result of split with input x
      Set (d, z) to the result of splitAt 1 with input y
      Return a concatenated with b concatenated with reverse c concatenated with d concatenated with parse z

  Define function main with no input and output IO ()
    Set buffering for stdin and stdout to NoBuffering
    Get contents from stdin
    Apply parse to the input and take while the result is not '.'
    Print the result of the previous step
    Print a new line with "."
