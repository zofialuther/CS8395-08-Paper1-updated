1. Define a function isSorted that takes a list of strings and checks if the strings are sorted in ascending order.
2. Define a function getLines that reads the lines from a file and returns them as a list of strings.
3. In the main function:
   a. Read the lines from the file "unixdict.txt" using getLines and store them in ls.
   b. Filter the list ls using isSorted and store the result in ow.
   c. Find the maximum length of strings in ow and store it in maxl.
   d. Print the strings from ow that have the maximum length. 

Pseudocode:

function isSorted(wws):
    return and(zipWith(<=, wws, tail(wws)))

function getLines(filename):
    lines = readFile(filename)
    return lines

function main():
    ls = getLines("unixdict.txt")
    ow = filter(isSorted, ls)
    maxl = foldr(max, 0, map(length, ow))
    print(filter(lambda w: length(w) == maxl, ow))
