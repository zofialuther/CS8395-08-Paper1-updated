```
1. Define a class Logger with a type parameter m that must be a Monad
2. Inside the Logger class, define a function write that takes a String and returns a value of type m ()
3. Define an instance of Logger for the IO type where write is equal to putStr
4. Define an instance of Logger for the Writer monad where the type parameter is String and write is equal to tell
5. Define a function verbose2 that takes a function f, two parameters x and y
6. Inside verbose2, write the result of f x y to the log using the write function, and then return the result
7. Inside the write statement, concatenate the strings "x", "y", "==> " and the result of f x y, and append a newline character
8. Define a local variable res which is the result of applying f to x and y
