Pseudocode:
1. Define the function repCycles with input parameter cs of type String and output type [String]
2. Inside the function, filter the list of strings by a condition that checks if the input string cs is equal to the first n characters of the cyclic repetition of each string, where n is the length of cs.
3. Use the functions take, cycle, tail, inits, quot, and length to achieve the filtering condition.
4. Define the main function of type IO ()
5. Inside the main function, use putStrLn to print the result of calling the fTable function with specific input parameters.
6. Define the fTable function with input parameters s, xShow, fxShow, f, and xs, and output type String.
7. Inside the fTable function, use let to define a helper function rjust and calculate the maximum length of the string representations of the input list xs.
8. Use unlines to concatenate the input string s with the mapped results of applying the functions xShow, fxShow, and f to the input list xs.
