1. Define a function called "transform" with parameters "s" and "copyList"
2. Set the transformation variable to the result of the following operations:
   a. Scale the "s" value by "s" in both x and y directions
   b. Rotate by 36 degrees
   c. Perform the foldMap operation on the "copyList" using the copy function and the list [0, 72, 144, 216, 288]
3. End of function.
