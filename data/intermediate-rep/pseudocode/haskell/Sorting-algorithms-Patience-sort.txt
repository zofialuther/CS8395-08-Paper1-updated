1. Initialize a newtype called Pile with a single constructor that takes a list of elements.
2. Create an instance of the Eq typeclass for Pile where two Pile instances are equal if their first elements are equal.
3. Create an instance of the Ord typeclass for Pile where Pile instances are compared based on their first elements.
4. Define a function called patienceSort that takes a list of elements and returns a sorted list using the patience sort algorithm.
5. Inside patienceSort, define a function called sortIntoPiles that takes a list and sorts it into multiple piles using the patience sort algorithm.
6. Inside sortIntoPiles, use the runST function to create a new ST array to store the piles.
7. Define a helper function called bsearchPiles that uses binary search to find the correct pile to insert an element into.
8. Define a helper function called f that inserts an element into the correct pile and updates the length of the pile array.
9. Return the sorted piles as a single list.
10. Define a function called mergePiles that takes a list of piles and merges them into a single sorted list using the patience sort algorithm.
11. Inside mergePiles, use the unfoldr function to repeatedly extract the minimum element from the set of piles and merge them into a single list.
12. Define the main function that prints the result of calling patienceSort with a test input list.
