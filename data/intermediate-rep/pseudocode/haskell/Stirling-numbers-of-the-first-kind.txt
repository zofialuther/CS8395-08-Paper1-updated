Function stirling1 takes a pair of integral numbers (n, k) and returns an integral number.

The function f checks for base cases where n is 0 and k is 0, n is greater than 0 and k is 0, k is greater than n, and for all other cases.

In the main function, it prints the header for the table, then generates the table using stirling1 and a list of pairs from 0 to 12. It also finds the maximum value of S1(100, k) and prints it.

Pseudocode:
1. Import necessary libraries (Text.Printf, Data.List, Data.MemoCombinators)

2. Define the function stirling1 that takes a pair of integral numbers (n, k) and returns an integral number.
  a. Use Memo.pair to memoize the function f
  b. Define the function f that checks for base cases and calculates the result using recursion.

3. Define the main function that performs the following tasks:
  a. Print the header for the table
  b. Generate the table using stirling1 and a list of pairs from 0 to 12
  c. Find the maximum value of S1(100, k) and print it

4. Define the table as a list of pairs from 0 to 12 using groupBy to group them by the first element.

5. End of pseudocode.

Note: This pseudocode assumes basic familiarity with Haskell syntax and libraries.
