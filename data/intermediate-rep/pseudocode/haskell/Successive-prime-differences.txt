```
1. Define type Result as a list of tuples where the first element is a String and the second element is a list of Integers.

2. Define function oneMillionPrimes to generate a list of primes less than 1,000,000.

3. Define function getGroups that takes a list of Integers and returns a Result. 
   If the list is empty, return an empty list.
   If the list has at least 4 elements, check the differences between the elements and add the corresponding tuple to the Result list.
   If the list has less than 4 elements, call getGroups recursively with the tail of the list.

4. Define a global variable groups that stores the Result obtained by calling getGroups with oneMillionPrimes.

5. Define function showGroup that takes a String and prints information about the groups that match the given String.
   Print the number of groups that match the String and the first and last elements of each matching group.

6. Define the main function to call showGroup with specific Strings in a sequence.
