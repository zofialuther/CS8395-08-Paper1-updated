1. Import necessary libraries:
   - import Data.Text (splitOn, intercalate)
   - import qualified Data.Text.IO as T (putStrLn)

2. Define the main function:
   - main = T.putStrLn . intercalate "." $ splitOn "," "Hello,How,Are,You,Today"

3. Pseudocode:
   - Define main function
   - Use splitOn to split the string "Hello,How,Are,You,Today" by ","
   - Use intercalate to join the split strings with "."
   - Output the result using T.putStrLn
