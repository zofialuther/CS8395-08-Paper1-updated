1. Import the necessary modules for working with prime numbers.

2. Define a variable "primes1e6" as the reverse of the result of filtering the list of primes less than or equal to 1,000,000, removing those containing the digit '0'.

3. Define two functions "rightT" and "leftT" to check if a number is right-truncatable and left-truncatable, respectively.

4. Define the "main" function to:
   a. Find the first left-truncatable and right-truncatable numbers from the list of "primes1e6".
   b. Print the results.
