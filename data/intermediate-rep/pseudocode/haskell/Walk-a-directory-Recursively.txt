```
import System.Environment
import System.Directory
import System.FilePath.Find

search pat = find always (fileName ~~? pat)

main = do
  [pat] <- getArgs
  dir <- getCurrentDirectory
  files <- search pat dir
  mapM_ putStrLn files
```

Translated pseudocode:
1. Import necessary modules: System.Environment, System.Directory, System.FilePath.Find
2. Define a function called search that takes a pattern as input and uses the find function to search for files that match the pattern.
3. Define the main function:
   a. Get the command line argument as the pattern and store it in the variable [pat].
   b. Get the current working directory and store it in the variable dir.
   c. Use the search function to find files that match the pattern in the current directory and store the result in the variable files.
   d. Print each file in the list of files.
