```
Begin
  Import necessary modules
  
  Define frequencies function that takes a list of Text and returns an IO (HashMap Text (IORef Int))
  Begin
    Use foldM to apply a function (M.alterF alter) to each element of the list and accumulate the results
    Define the alter function
      If the element is Nothing, create a new IORef for the element with a value of 1
      If the element is not Nothing, modify the IORef by incrementing its value by 1
  End
  
  Define main function
    Begin
      Read command line arguments
      Check if there is exactly 1 argument, otherwise throw an error
      Parse the argument as the maximum number of words to print
      Read the contents of stdin as Text
      Apply the filter and map functions to the contents to remove whitespace and convert to lowercase
      Apply the frequencies function to the result
      Use mapM to read the values of the IORefs in the frequency table
      Print the top maxw words sorted by frequency count in descending order
    End
End
