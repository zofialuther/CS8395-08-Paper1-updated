1. Start
2. Define a class ABC
3. Define a main method
4. Create a list of strings called blocks

7. Define a method called canMakeWord that takes a word and a list of blocks as parameters
8. If the word is empty, return true
9. Get the first character of the word
10. Iterate through the blocks
11. If the first or second character of the block matches the first character of the word, swap the block with the first block in the list
12. Recursively call canMakeWord with the remaining word and the sublist of blocks
13. If the recursive call returns true, return true
14. Swap the blocks back to their original positions
15. If no match is found, return false
