1. Import necessary libraries: java.io.File, java.io.IOException, java.nio.file.Files, java.util.ArrayList, java.util.Arrays, java.util.Comparator, java.util.HashMap, java.util.List, java.util.Map
2. Create a public class called DerangedAnagrams
3. Create a main method
4. Inside the main method, read all lines from the "unixdict.txt" file and store them in a List called words
5. Call the printLongestDerangedAnagram method and pass the words list as a parameter
6. Create a private static method called printLongestDerangedAnagram that takes a List of Strings as a parameter
7. Sort the words list in descending order of length and then by natural order
8. Create a HashMap called map to store the anagrams
9. Iterate through each word in the words list
10. Convert the word to a char array and sort it
11. Create a key from the sorted char array
12. Check if the key already exists in the map, if not, create a new ArrayList for the key
13. Iterate through the anagrams list for the key
14. Check if the word is deranged with any of the existing anagrams, if so, print the anagram and word and return
15. If no deranged anagrams are found, add the word to the anagrams list for the key
16. If no deranged anagrams are found, print "no result"
17. Create a private static method called isDeranged that takes two String parameters (word1 and word2)
18. Iterate through each character in the words and check if they are equal, if so, return false
19. If no equal characters are found, return true
