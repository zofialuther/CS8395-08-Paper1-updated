1. Initialize a class named BellTriangle with a private list of integers called arr.
2. Create a constructor for BellTriangle that takes an integer n as a parameter.
3. Calculate the length of the array using the formula length = n * (n + 1) / 2.
4. Initialize the arr list with length number of elements, all set to 0.
5. Set the value at index 1, 0 to 1.
6. Use a nested loop to calculate the values for the Bell triangle using the set and get methods.
7. Create a private method called index that takes row and col as parameters and returns the index in the arr list.
8. Create public methods get and set that take row, col, and value as parameters to get and set values in the Bell triangle.
9. In the main method, initialize a constant integer rows to 15 and create a new BellTriangle object called bt with rows as the parameter.
10. Print "First fifteen Bell numbers:".
11. Use a loop to iterate through the first 15 rows and print the Bell numbers.
12. Use a nested loop to print the Bell triangle values for the first 10 rows.
