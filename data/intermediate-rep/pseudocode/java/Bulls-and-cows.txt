1. Import necessary libraries
2. Create a class called BullsAndCows
3. Inside the class, create a main method
4. Inside the main method, create a Random object called gen
5. Declare an integer variable called target
6. Use a while loop to check for duplicate digits in the target number and assign a random 4-digit number to target
7. Convert the target integer to a string and store it in a variable called targetStr
8. Declare a boolean variable called guessed and set it to false
9. Create a Scanner object called input
10. Declare an integer variable called guesses and set it to 0
11. Use a do-while loop to start the game
12. Inside the do-while loop, declare two integer variables called bulls and cows and set them to 0
13. Ask the user to input a 4-digit number and store it in a variable called guess
14. Use a try-catch block to handle InputMismatchException and continue the loop if an exception occurs
15. Increment the guesses variable
16. Convert the guess integer to a string and store it in a variable called guessStr
17. Use a for loop to iterate through the digits of the guess and compare them with the target
18. If a digit in the guess matches the corresponding digit in the target, increment the bulls variable, else check if the digit exists in the target and increment the cows variable
19. If all digits match, set guessed to true, else print the number of cows and bulls
20. Continue the do-while loop until guessed is true
21. Print the number of guesses it took to win
22. Create a method called hasDupes that takes an integer as input
23. Inside the hasDupes method, create a boolean array called digs with a length of 10
24. Use a while loop to check for duplicate digits in the input number by iterating through each digit
25. If a digit is already present in the array, return true
26. If not, set the corresponding index in the array to true and continue checking for duplicate digits
27. If no duplicate digits are found, return false from the method
