Create a class CatlanNumbers
    Define a main method
        Create an instance f1 of Catlan1
        Create an instance f2 of Catlan2
        Create an instance f3 of Catlan3
        Print "           Formula 1     Formula 2     Formula 3" to the console
        Iterate through values of n from 0 to 15
            Print the values of C(n) for each formula for the current value of n
    Define an interface Catlan
        Define a method catlin that takes a long n and returns a BigInteger
    Define a class Catlan1 that implements the Catlan interface
        Override the catlin method
            Create an empty list numerator
            Iterate through values of k from n+2 to 2*n
                Add k to the numerator list
            Create an empty list denominator
            Iterate through values of k from 2 to n
                Add k to the denominator list
            Iterate through values of i from the length of numerator list - 1 to 0
                Iterate through values of j from the length of denominator list - 1 to 0
                    If the value at index j in the denominator list is 1, continue to the next iteration
                    If the remainder of the division of the value at index i in the numerator list by the value at index j in the denominator list is 0
                        Set val to the result of the division
                        Set the value at index i in the numerator list to val
                        Remove the value at index j from the denominator list
                        If val is 1, break the loop
            Create a BigInteger catlin and set it to 1
            Iterate through values of i from 0 to the length of numerator list
                Multiply catlin by the value at index i in the numerator list
            Iterate through values of i from 0 to the length of denominator list
                Divide catlin by the value at index i in the denominator list
            Return catlin
    Define a class Catlan2 that implements the Catlan interface
        Create a static Map CACHE and add the key-value pair (0L, BigInteger.ONE)
        Override the catlin method
            If the CACHE contains the key n
                Return the value associated with the key n in the CACHE
            Create a BigInteger catlin and set it to 0
            Decrement n by 1
            Iterate through values of i from 0 to n
                Add the product of catlin(i) and catlin(n-i) to catlin
            Add the key-value pair (n+1, catlin) to the CACHE
            Return catlin
    Define a class Catlan3 that implements the Catlan interface
        Create a static Map CACHE and add the key-value pair (0L, BigInteger.ONE)
        Override the catlin method
            If the CACHE contains the key n
                Return the value associated with the key n in the CACHE
            Create a BigInteger catlin and set it to 2 multiplied by 2*n-1 multiplied by catlin(n-1) and then divided by n+1
            Add the key-value pair (n, catlin) to the CACHE
            Return catlin
