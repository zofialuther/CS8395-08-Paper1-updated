1. Import the Random class from java.util package
2. Create a class called FuzzyCircle
3. Declare a static final variable rnd of type Random
4. Create a main method that takes an array of strings as input
5. Create a 2D array called field with dimensions 31x31
6. Use nested for loops to initialize all elements of the field array to ' '
7. Declare a variable pointsInDisc and initialize it to 0
8. Create a while loop that runs as long as pointsInDisc is less than 100
9. Inside the while loop, generate random x and y coordinates using the rnd.nextInt(31) - 15 method
10. Calculate the distance from the origin using Math.hypot(x, y)
11. Check if the distance is between 10 and 15 and if the corresponding element in the field array is empty
12. If the conditions are met, set the element in the field array to 'X' and increment pointsInDisc
13. Use nested for-each loops to print each element of the field array
14. End the main method.
