4. Create a main method
5. Initialize an array called balls with length 12
6. Get the values of the DutchColors enum and store them in a separate array called values
7. Create a Random object called rand
8. Use a for loop to iterate through the balls array and assign random values from the values array to each element
9. Print the array before sorting
10. Sort the balls array using Arrays.sort method
11. Print the array after sorting
12. Create a boolean variable called sorted and set it to true
13. Use a for loop to iterate through the sorted array and check if each element is in the correct order
14. If an element is out of order, set sorted to false and break the loop
15. Print whether the array is correctly sorted or not
