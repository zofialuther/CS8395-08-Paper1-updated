1. Create a function called divide that takes in two parameters: dividend and divisor

2. Create an empty list called powersOf2
3. Create an empty list called doublings

4. Initialize a variable called line to 0
5. While (2 raised to the power of line multiplied by divisor) is less than or equal to dividend
6.     - Add 2 raised to the power of line to the powersOf2 list
7.     - Add (2 raised to the power of line) multiplied by divisor to the doublings list
8.     - Increment line by 1

9. Initialize the answer variable to 0
10. Initialize the accumulator variable to 0

11. Loop through the powersOf2 list in reverse order
12.     - If accumulator plus the value at index i in the doublings list is less than or equal to dividend
13.         - Add the value at index i in the doublings list to the accumulator
14.         - Add the value at index i in the powersOf2 list to the answer

15. Print the answer and the remainder (dividend minus accumulator) to the console

16. In the main function, call the divide function with the values 580 and 34 as parameters.
