Pseudocode:

1. Import required libraries
2. Define a class WolframCA that extends JPanel
3. Initialize ruleSet array with specific values
4. Initialize cells array and rule integer variable
5. Create a constructor for WolframCA class
   a. Set preferred size and background color
   b. Initialize cells array with dimensions
   c. Set initial value for cells array
   d. Create a Timer to change the rule every 5 seconds and repaint the panel
6. Create a method rules to determine the next generation value based on the rule
7. Create a method drawCa to draw the cellular automaton based on the rules
8. Create a method drawLegend to display the current rule value
9. Override the paintComponent method to call drawCa and drawLegend
10. Create a main method to create and display the JFrame with WolframCA panel.
