Pseudocode:

1. Create a Scanner object to read input from the user
2. Read the first integer input and store it in the variable "first"
3. Read the second integer input and store it in the variable "second"
4. If the value of "first" is less than 0, make it positive and also make "second" negative
5. Create a HashMap called "columns" to store pairs of integers
6. Add a key-value pair to "columns" with "first" as the key and "second" as the value
7. Initialize a variable "sum" to 0 if "first" is even, otherwise initialize it to the value of "second"
8. Repeat the following steps while "first" is greater than 1:
   a. Halve the value of "first" using the "halveInt" function and store the result back in "first"
   b. Double the value of "second" using the "doubleInt" function and store the result back in "second"
   c. Add a key-value pair to "columns" with the new value of "first" as the key and the new value of "second" as the value
   d. If "first" is not even, add the value of "second" to the "sum"
9. Print the value of "sum"

Functions:
- doubleInt: Takes an integer as input and returns the result of left shifting the integer by 1
- halveInt: Takes an integer as input and returns the result of right shifting the integer by 1
- isEven: Takes an integer as input and returns true if the integer is even, otherwise returns false
