1. Import the necessary libraries: java.util.AbstractList, java.util.Collections, and java.util.Scanner.

2. Create a class called GuessNumber.

3. Define two constant variables LOWER and UPPER with values 0 and 100 respectively.

4. Create a main method with the following code:
   a. Print instructions for the game.
   b. Use Collections.binarySearch to perform a binary search for the guessed number.
   c. Create an AbstractList with overridden size and get methods to handle user input and guessing.

5. Within the AbstractList, implement the size method to return the range of numbers between LOWER and UPPER.

6. Implement the get method to:
   a. Prompt the user for their response to the guess.
   b. Handle the user's response and return -1 if the guess is too low, 1 if the guess is too high, and 0 if the guess is correct.

7. Check the result of the binary search:
   a. If the result is less than 0, print "That is impossible."
   b. If the result is valid, print "Your number is [result]".

Pseudocode:
```
import java.util.AbstractList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Scanner;

class GuessNumber {
    public static final int LOWER = 0, UPPER = 100;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Print instructions for the game
        
        Perform binary search using Collections.binarySearch and AbstractList
            Override the size method to return the range of numbers between LOWER and UPPER
            Override the get method to handle user input and guessing
        
        Check the result of the binary search:
            If result < 0
                Print "That is impossible."
            Else
                Print "Your number is [result]".
    }
}
```
