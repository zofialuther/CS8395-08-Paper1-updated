1. Import the necessary libraries: java.util.Random and java.util.Scanner
2. Define the Main class
3. Define the main method
4. Create a new Scanner object called "scan" to read input from the user
5. Create a new Random object called "random" to generate random numbers
6. Set the range for the random number generation (from 1 to 100)
7. Generate a random number within the specified range and store it in the variable "randomNumber"
8. Initialize the variable "guessedNumber" to 0
9. Display the message "The number is between from and to" using the values of "from" and "to"
10. Start a do-while loop
11. Prompt the user to guess the number and store their input in the variable "guessedNumber"
12. Check if the guessed number is higher than the random number and display "Your guess is too high!" if true
13. Check if the guessed number is lower than the random number and display "Your guess is too low!" if true
14. If neither of the above conditions are true, display "You got it!"
15. Continue looping until the guessed number is equal to the random number
16. End of the do-while loop
17. End of the main method
18. End of the Main class
