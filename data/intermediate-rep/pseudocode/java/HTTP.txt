1. Import necessary libraries:
    - java.net.URI
    - java.net.http.HttpClient
    - java.net.http.HttpRequest
    - java.net.http.HttpResponse
    - java.nio.charset.Charset

2. Create a class called Main.

3. Define a public static void main method that takes an array of strings as input.

4. Inside the main method:
    a. Create a HttpRequest object using the builder pattern with the URI "https://www.rosettacode.org", set the request method to GET, and build the request.

    b. Use the HttpClient.newHttpClient() method to create a new HttpClient, then call the sendAsync method with the request and HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString(Charset.defaultCharset()) as parameters. This returns a CompletableFuture<HttpResponse<String>>.

    c. Use the thenApply method to extract the body from the HttpResponse object.

    d. Use the thenAccept method to print the body to the console.

    e. Call the join method to block and wait for the asynchronous request to complete.

5. End of main method.
