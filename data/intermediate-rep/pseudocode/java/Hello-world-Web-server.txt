1. Import the necessary libraries: java.io.IOException, java.io.PrintWriter, java.net.ServerSocket, java.net.Socket
2. Create a class called HelloWorld
3. Define a main method that throws IOException
4. Within the main method, create a ServerSocket called listener and initialize it with port 8080
5. Start a while loop that continues indefinitely
6. Inside the while loop, accept incoming connections using listener.accept() and store it in a Socket variable called sock
7. Create a new PrintWriter object to write to the output stream of the socket and print the message "Goodbye, World!"
8. Close the socket using sock.close()
9. End the while loop
10. End the main method
11. End the class definition.
