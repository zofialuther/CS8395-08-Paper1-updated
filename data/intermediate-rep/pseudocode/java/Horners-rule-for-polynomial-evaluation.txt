  Class Horner
    Function main
      Create a new ArrayList called coeffs
      Add -19.0 to coeffs
      Add 7.0 to coeffs
      Add -4.0 to coeffs
      Add 6.0 to coeffs
      Print the result of polyEval with coeffs and 3 as parameters

    Function polyEval with parameters coefficients and x
      Reverse the order of coefficients
      Create a variable called accumulator and set it to the first element of coefficients
      For each element in coefficients starting from the second element
        Update accumulator by multiplying it with x and adding the current element
      End for
      Return accumulator
    End Function
