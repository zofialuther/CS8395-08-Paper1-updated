1. Import the necessary libraries: java.io.BufferedReader, java.io.FileReader

2. Create a class named KernighansLargeEarthquakeProblem

3. Define the main method with a throws Exception clause

4. Create a BufferedReader object named reader and initialize it with a FileReader object that reads from "data.txt"

5. Initialize a String variable inLine to null

6. Create a while loop that continues as long as the value of inLine is not null

7. Within the while loop, split the inLine string by whitespace and store the resulting array in a variable named split

8. Parse the third element of the split array as a double and store it in a variable named magnitude

9. Check if the magnitude is greater than 6

10. If true, print the value of inLine

11. Close the try-with-resources block

12. End of the main method and class.
