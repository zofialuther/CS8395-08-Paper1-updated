1. Create an interface IntConcat
2. Define a static Comparator<Integer> SORTER
3. Inside SORTER, compare two integers o1 and o2 by converting them to strings
4. If the lengths of the strings are equal, return the result of comparing o2s to o1s
5. If the lengths are not equal, find the maximum length between o1 and o2
6. While the length of o1s is less than mlen * 2, concatenate o1s with itself
7. While the length of o2s is less than mlen * 2, concatenate o2s with itself
8. Return the result of comparing o2s to o1s
9. Define the main method
10. Create a Stream of Integers ints1 with specified values
11. Print the result of sorting ints1 in parallel using SORTER, converting to strings and joining
12. Create a Stream of Integers ints2 with specified values
13. Print the result of sorting ints2 in parallel using SORTER, converting to strings and joining
