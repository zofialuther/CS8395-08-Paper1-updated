1. Create a class LastLetterFirstLetter
2. Set maxPathLength to 0
3. Set maxPathLengthCount to 0
4. Create a StringBuffer maxPathExample with a capacity of 500
5. Create an array of strings called names with the given list of names
6. Create a function called recursive that takes an array of strings called part and an integer offset as parameters
7. If the offset is greater than maxPathLength, set maxPathLength to offset and maxPathLengthCount to 1
8. If the offset is equal to maxPathLength, increment maxPathLengthCount and build the maxPathExample string
9. Get the last character of the string at index offset - 1
10. Iterate through the part array starting from the offset
11. If the first character of the current string is the same as the last character, swap the names at the offset and current index, then call the recursive function with offset + 1
12. Swap the names back to their original positions after the recursive call
13. Create a main function that takes an array of strings args as a parameter
14. Iterate through the names array
15. Swap the names at index 0 and the current index, then call the recursive function with offset 1
16. Swap the names back to their original positions after the recursive call
17. Print the maximum path length, paths of that length, and an example path of that length.
