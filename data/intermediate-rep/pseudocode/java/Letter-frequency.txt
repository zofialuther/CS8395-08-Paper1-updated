1. Set up a try-catch block to handle any potential IOExceptions
2. Create a new FileInputStream object and pass the file name as a parameter
3. Create a new InputStreamReader object and pass the FileInputStream object as a parameter
4. Create a new HashMap object to store the data from the file
5. Use a while loop to iterate through each character in the file
6. Read each character using the InputStreamReader object
7. Check if the character is already a key in the HashMap
8. If it is, increment the value associated with that key by 1
9. If it is not, add the character as a key in the HashMap with a value of 1
10. Close the InputStreamReader and FileInputStream objects
11. Catch any IOExceptions and handle them appropriately (e.g. print an error message)
12. Use the HashMap to access and manipulate the data as needed.
