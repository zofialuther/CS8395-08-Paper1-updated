1. Create a function called distance that takes in two String parameters, a and b
2. Convert both a and b to lowercase
3. Create an array called costs with a length of b + 1
4. Loop through the costs array and set each element to its index
5. Loop through the characters of string a
6. Set costs[0] to i
7. Set nw to i - 1
8. Loop through the characters of string b
9. Calculate cj using the minimum of 1 + the minimum of costs[j], costs[j - 1], and nw, and also check if the characters at positions i and j are the same
10. Set nw to the current value of costs[j]
11. Set costs[j] to cj
12. Return costs[b.length()]
13. Create a main function that takes no parameters
14. Create an array called data with some example strings
15. Loop through the data array with a step of 2
16. Print the result of calling distance with the current and next elements of the data array.
