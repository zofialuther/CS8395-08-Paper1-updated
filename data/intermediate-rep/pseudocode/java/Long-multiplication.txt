1. Import the necessary library for the code
2. Create a class called LongMultBinary
3. Create a nested class called MyLongNum which implements Cloneable
4. Declare private instance variables digits and digitsUsed
5. Implement the clone method to create a deep copy of the MyLongNum object
6. Create a private method resize to resize the digits array
7. Create a private method adjustDigitsUsed to adjust the number of digits used in the array
8. Implement the multiply method to perform short multiplication by one digit
9. Implement the add method to perform short addition (adding a one-digit number)
10. Implement the divide method to perform short division (dividing by a one-digit number)
11. Create a constructor for MyLongNum that takes a String value and initializes the MyLongNum object with the given value
12. Implement the toString method to convert the MyLongNum object to a String
13. Implement the multiply method to perform long multiplication
14. Create the main method
15. Inside the main method, create two MyLongNum objects, initialize them with a string value, multiply them, and print the result.
