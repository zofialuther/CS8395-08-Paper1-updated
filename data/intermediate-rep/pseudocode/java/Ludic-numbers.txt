1. Create a new class called Ludic
2. Create a method called ludicUpTo that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of integers
3. Create an empty list called ludics
4. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n and add each number to the ludics list
5. Use a for loop to iterate through the ludics list
6. Get the current ludic number from the list
7. Calculate the index of the next number to remove
8. Use a while loop to remove numbers from the list at the calculated index
9. Update the removeCursor index for the next iteration
10. Return the updated ludics list
11. Create a method called getTriplets that takes a list of integers called ludics as input and returns a list of lists of integers
12. Create an empty list called triplets
13. Use a for loop to iterate through the ludics list
14. Get the current ludic number from the list
15. Check if ludics list contains ludic number + 2 and ludic number + 6
16. If both conditions are true, create a new list called triplet and add the three numbers to it
17. Add the triplet to the triplets list
18. Return the triplets list
19. Create a main method
20. Print the first 25 Ludics using the ludicUpTo method with 110 as input
21. Print the number of Ludics up to 1000 using the ludicUpTo method with 1000 as input
22. Print the 2000th - 2005th Ludics using the ludicUpTo method with 22000 as input and using subList to get the specific range
23. Print the Triplets up to 250 using the getTriplets method with ludicUpTo method with 250 as input
