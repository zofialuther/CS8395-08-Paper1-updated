Create a new class MutualRecursion
    Create a main method that takes in an array of strings as input
        Set max = 20
        Print "First %d values of the Female sequence:  %n", max
        For i = 0 to max
            Print "  f(%d) = %d%n", i, f(i)
        Print "First %d values of the Male sequence:  %n", max
        For i = 0 to 20
            Print "  m(%d) = %d%n", i, m(i)

    Create a private static Map F_MAP and set it equal to a new HashMap
    Create a private static method f that takes in an integer n
        If F_MAP contains key n
            Return the value of F_MAP at key n
        Set fn = if n equals 0 then 1 else n - m(f(n - 1))
        Put n and fn into F_MAP
        Return fn

    Create a private static Map M_MAP and set it equal to a new HashMap
    Create a private static method m that takes in an integer n
        If M_MAP contains key n
            Return the value of M_MAP at key n
        Set mn = if n equals 0 then 0 else n - f(m(n - 1))
        Put n and mn into M_MAP
        Return mn
