  Define main function
    Iterate through a stream of integers from 0 to Integer.MAX_VALUE
      Convert integer to string and get its length
      Initialize addedDigits as 0

      Iterate through each digit in the integer
        Convert digit to integer value
        Add the value raised to the power of the length to addedDigits

      If the integer is equal to addedDigits
        Increment numbersCalculated
        Print addedDigits

      If numbersCalculated is equal to numbersToCalculate
        Exit the program
