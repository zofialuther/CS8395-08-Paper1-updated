1. Start
2. Initialize gameList as an empty list
3. Initialize ReversalGame
4. Call initialize() method
5. Call play() method
6. Define initialize() method
    - Initialize gameList as a new ArrayList of integers
    - Add integers from 1 to 9 to gameList
    - Shuffle gameList while it is sorted
7. Define play() method
    - Initialize i and moveCount to 0
    - Create a new Scanner object
    - Start a while loop that runs indefinitely
        - Print gameList
        - Prompt user to enter an index to reverse from 2 to 9 or enter 99 to quit
        - Read user input into i
        - If i is 99, break the loop
        - If i is less than 2 or greater than 9, print "Invalid input"
        - Else, increment moveCount and call reverse(i) method
        - If gameList is sorted, print "Congratulations you solved this in " + moveCount + " moves!" and break the loop
    - Close the scanner
8. Define reverse(position) method
    - Reverse the sublist of gameList from 0 to position
9. Define isSorted() method
    - Start a for loop from 0 to gameList size - 1
        - If gameList at index i is greater than gameList at index i + 1, return false
    - Return true
10. Define main method
    - Try
        - Create a new ReversalGame object
        - Call play() method
    - Catch any exceptions and print error message and stack trace
11. End
