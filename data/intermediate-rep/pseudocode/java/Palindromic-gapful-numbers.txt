initialize map to store palindromic gapful numbers
initialize mapCount to store count of numbers for each key
for i from 1 to 9:
    add key i to map with an empty list as value
    add key i to mapCount with 0 as value

while notPopulated is true:

        get the last digit of n and store it in index
        if the count of index in mapCount is less than firstHowMany:
            add n to the list at index in map
            increase the count of index in mapCount by 1
            if the size of list at index in map is greater than countReturned:
                remove the first element from the list at index in map
