1. Create a function called isPrime that takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value.
2. If n is less than 2, return false.
3. If n is divisible by 2, return true only if n is equal to 2.
4. If n is divisible by 3, return true only if n is equal to 3.
5. Set d to 5.
6. While d multiplied by d is less than or equal to n, do the following:
   - If n is divisible by d, return false.
   - Increment d by 2.
   - If n is divisible by d, return false.
   - Increment d by 4.
7. Return true.

8. Create a function called findCombo that takes integers k, x, m, n, and an array combo as input and returns a boolean value.
9. Set foundCombo to false.
10. If k is greater than or equal to m, do the following:
    - If the sum of prime numbers at indices specified by combo in the primes array is equal to x, then:
        - Print the partitioned number and the prime numbers.
        - Set foundCombo to true.
11. Otherwise, do the following:
    - For j from 0 to n-1, do the following:
        - If k is 0 or j is greater than the value at combo[k-1], then:
            - Set the value at combo[k] to j.
            - If foundCombo is still false, call findCombo recursively with k+1, x, m, n, and combo.
12. Return foundCombo.

13. Create a function called partition that takes integers x and m as input and has no return value.
14. If x is less than 2 or m is less than 1 or m is greater than or equal to x, throw an IllegalArgumentException.
15. Create an array called filteredPrimes containing prime numbers from the primes array that are less than or equal to x.
16. Get the length of the filteredPrimes array and store it in n.
17. If n is less than m, throw an IllegalArgumentException with the message "Not enough primes".
18. Create an array combo of size m.
19. Call findCombo with initial values 0, x, m, n, and combo and store the result in foundCombo.
20. If foundCombo is false, print that it is not possible to partition the number.

21. In the main function:
    - Call partition with the specified numbers and m values to test the functionality of the program.
