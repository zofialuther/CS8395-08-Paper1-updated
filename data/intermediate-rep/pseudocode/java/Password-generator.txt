```
1. Start
2. Import the java.util package
3. Create a class called PasswordGenerator
4. Declare a final static Random variable called rand and initialize it with a new Random object
5. Create a public static void main method with a parameter of String array args
6. Declare and initialize variables num and len
7. Try the following:
    - Check if the length of args is not equal to 2, then throw an IllegalArgumentException
    - Parse the first element of args to an integer and assign it to len
    - Check if len is less than 4 or greater than 16, then throw an IllegalArgumentException
    - Parse the second element of args to an integer and assign it to num
    - Check if num is less than 1 or greater than 10, then throw an IllegalArgumentException
    - Iterate through the generated passwords using the generatePasswords method and print each password
8. Catch IllegalArgumentException and print a message prompting for the length and number of passwords
9. Create a private static method called generatePasswords with parameters num and len
10. Declare a final String variable s containing special characters
11. Create a List of Strings called result
12. Iterate through the range of num
    - Create a StringBuilder object called sb
    - Append a random special character, a random number, a random lowercase letter, and a random uppercase letter to sb
    - Iterate from 4 to len
        - Generate a random character from the special characters range and append it to sb
        - If the character is a backslash or backtick, decrement the counter
    - Add the shuffled sb to the result list
13. Return the result list
14. Create a public static method called shuffle with a parameter of StringBuilder sb
15. Get the length of the StringBuilder and iterate through it
    - Generate a random index within the range and swap the characters at the current index and the random index
16. Return the shuffled StringBuilder as a String
17. End
