1. Import required libraries: java.util.Arrays, java.util.EnumMap, java.util.List, java.util.Map, java.util.Scanner, java.util.Random

2. Create a class called RPS

3. Define an enum called Item with values ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS. Uncommented values LIZARD and SPOCK are ignored.

4. Inside the Item enum, create a list called losesToList and a method called losesTo that takes an Item as input and returns a boolean.

5. Inside the static block of the Item enum, define the losesToList for each item.

6. Create a Map called counts using EnumMap and initialize it with each Item and a count of 1.

7. Create a variable called totalThrows and set it to the length of the Item enum.

8. Define the main method that creates an instance of RPS and calls the run method.

9. Define the run method that takes user input using a Scanner and continuously prompts the user to make a choice.

10. Inside the run method, get the AI's choice using the getAIChoice method and compare it with the user's choice.

11. If the user's choice is invalid, continue the loop.

12. If the user's choice is valid, increment the count for that choice, increment totalThrows, display the AI's choice, and determine the winner based on the choices.

13. Define a static variable called rng of type Random.

14. Define a method called getAIChoice that uses a random number to select the AI's choice based on the counts of each Item.

15. End of pseudocode.
