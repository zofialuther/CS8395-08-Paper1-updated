1. Initialize a string variable called "inputString" with a sample input string
2. Initialize a string variable called "regexPattern" with a sample regular expression pattern
3. Create a Pattern object by calling Pattern.compile() method with "regexPattern" as the parameter
4. Create a Matcher object by calling pattern.matcher() method with "inputString" as the parameter
5. Use a while loop to iterate through the matches found by the Matcher object
6. Within the loop, use the Matcher object's group() method to retrieve the matched substring
7. Print out the matched substring
8. End the loop
9. End the program
