1. Create a function sieve()
    - Set MAX to 1,000,035
    - Create an array called primes of size MAX, initialized with all elements set to false
    - Loop from i = 2 to MAX
        - Set primes[i] to true
    - Loop from i = 2 to MAX
        - If primes[i] is true
            - Loop from j = 2*i to MAX, with increment of i
                - Set primes[j] to false

2. In the main function
    - Call sieve()
    - Initialize pairs, triples, quadruplets, and unsexyCount to 0
    - Create empty lists pairList, tripleList, quadrupletList, and unsexyList
    - Loop from i = 3 to MAX
        - If i-6 is greater than or equal to 3 and primes[i-6] is true and primes[i] is true
            - Increment pairs by 1
            - Add (i-6) + " " + i to pairList
            - If the size of pairList is greater than 5, remove the first element
        - Else if i is less than MAX-2 and primes[i] is true and (i+6 is less than MAX and primes[i] is true and primes[i+6] is false)
            - Increment unsexyCount by 1
            - Add i to unsexyList
            - If the size of unsexyList is greater than 10, remove the first element
        - If i-12 is greater than or equal to 3 and primes[i-12] is true and primes[i-6] is true and primes[i] is true
            - Increment triples by 1
            - Add (i-12) + " " + (i-6) + " " + i to tripleList
            - If the size of tripleList is greater than 5, remove the first element
        - If i-16 is greater than or equal to 3 and primes[i-18] is true and primes[i-12] is true and primes[i-6] is true and primes[i] is true
            - Increment quadruplets by 1
            - Add (i-18) + " " + (i-12) + " " + (i-6) + " " + i to quadrupletList
            - If the size of quadrupletList is greater than 5, remove the first element
    - Print the counts and lists of sexy pairs, triples, quadruplets, and unsexy primes using the formatted strings as shown in the code
