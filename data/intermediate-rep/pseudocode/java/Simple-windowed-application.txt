5. Inside the constructor:
   - Call the superclass constructor with the title "Clicks"

   - Set the layout of the frame to BorderLayout
   - Add the label to the center of the frame
   - Add the clicker button to the south of the frame
   - Set the preferred size of the label to 300x100

   - Pack the components to fix the layout
   - Set the default close operation to exit the program when the window is closed
