1. Create a new class Hidato

2. Declare private static int array board

3. Declare private static int arrays given and start

4. Create a main method
   - Create a String array input with the given input values
   - Call the setup method with the input array
   - Call the printBoard method to print the initial state of the board
   - Print "Found:"
   - Call the solve method with start[0], start[1], 1, and 0 as parameters
   - Call the printBoard method to print the final state of the board

5. Create a setup method with String array input as parameter
   - Create a 2D String array puzzle and split the input to populate it
   - Get the number of columns and rows from the puzzle array
   - Create a new ArrayList list with the size of nRows * nCols
   - Initialize the board array with dimensions nRows + 2 and nCols + 2, and set all values to -1
   - Loop through the puzzle array and populate the board array based on the values in the puzzle array
   - Sort the list and populate the given array with its values

6. Create a solve method with int r, int c, int n, and int next as parameters
   - Check if n is greater than the last value in the given array, return true
   - Check if the value in the board array at position r and c is not 0 and not equal to n, return false
   - Check if the value in the board array at position r and c is 0 and the next value in given array is equal to n, return false
   - Create a variable back and set it to the value in the board array at position r and c
   - Check if back is equal to n, increment next
   - Set the value in the board array at position r and c to n
   - Loop through the adjacent cells and recursively call the solve method with updated parameters
   - Set the value in the board array at position r and c back to its original value and return false

7. Create a printBoard method
   - Loop through the board array and print the values with appropriate formatting

8. End of class Hidato.
