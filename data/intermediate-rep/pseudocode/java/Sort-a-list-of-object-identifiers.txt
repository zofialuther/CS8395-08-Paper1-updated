  Define a class named OIDListSorting
    Define a main method that takes an array of strings as input
    
    Define a string variable "dot" and assign the value "\\."
    
    Define a comparator "oids_comparator" that takes two strings as input and returns an integer
      Split the input strings using the "dot" variable and store the result in o1Numbers and o2Numbers
      Iterate through the arrays using a for loop
        If the index i is equal to the length of both arrays, return 0
        If the index i is equal to the length of o1Numbers, return -1
        If the index i is equal to the length of o2Numbers, return 1
        Get the next number in o1Numbers and o2Numbers and store them in nextO1Number and nextO2Number
        Compare nextO1Number and nextO2Number and store the result in a variable "result"
        If the result is not equal to 0, return the result
      End loop
    End comparator definition
    
    Create a stream of strings containing OID values
      Sort the stream using the oids_comparator
      For each value in the sorted stream, print the value
    End stream definition
  End class definition
