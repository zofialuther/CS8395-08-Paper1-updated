1. Create a class BogoSort
2. Create a main method that takes in an array of integers as input
3. Initialize an array called arr with values {4,5,6,0,7,8,9,1,2,3}
4. Create an instance of BogoSort called now
5. Print "Unsorted: " followed by the elements of the array using the display1D method
6. Call the bogo method on the array
7. Print "Sorted: " followed by the elements of the array using the display1D method
8. Create a bogo method that takes in an array as input
9. Initialize a variable called shuffle to 1
10. Use a while loop to continue shuffling the array until it is sorted, keeping track of the number of shuffles
11. Print "This took " followed by the number of shuffles
12. Create a shuffle method that takes in an array as input
13. Use the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to shuffle the array
14. Create a swap method that takes in an array and two indices i and j as input
15. Swap the elements at indices i and j in the array
16. Create an isSorted method that takes in an array as input
17. Use a for loop to check if the array is sorted in ascending order, returning false if it is not
18. Create a display1D method that takes in an array as input
19. Use a for loop to print each element of the array followed by a space
20. Print a new line after printing all the elements of the array.
