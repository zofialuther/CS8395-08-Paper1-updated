Pseudocode for SleepSort:

1. Import the CountDownLatch class from java.util.concurrent package.

2. Define a class called SleepSort.

3. Create a static method called sleepSortAndPrint that takes an array of integers as input.

4. Inside sleepSortAndPrint method, create a CountDownLatch object called doneSignal with initial count equal to the length of the input array.

5. Iterate through each integer in the input array using a for loop.

6. Inside the loop, create a new thread for each integer using the Runnable interface.

7. Inside the run method of the Runnable interface, decrement the count of doneSignal using countDown() method.

8. Use a try-catch block to handle InterruptedException.

9. Inside the try block, wait for all threads to finish using await() method on doneSignal.

10. Use Thread.sleep() method to sleep for a duration equal to the current integer multiplied by 1000 milliseconds.

11. Print the integer to the console.

12. In the main method, create an array of integers by parsing the command line arguments.

13. Call the sleepSortAndPrint method with the array of integers as input.
