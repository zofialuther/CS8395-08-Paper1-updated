1. Create a class called SterlingNumbersFirstKind
2. Inside the class, create a main method
3. Print "Unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind:"
4. Set the maximum value to 12
5. Print "n/k"
6. Create a for loop with variable n from 0 to max
7. Print the value of n
8. Create a nested for loop with variable n from 0 to max
9. Print the value of n
10. Create a method called sterling1 with parameters n and k
11. Check if the result for n and k is already computed and return it if it is
12. Check if n is 0 and k is 0, return 1
13. Check if n is greater than 0 and k is 0, return 0
14. Check if k is greater than n, return 0
15. Calculate the result using the formula and store it in the COMPUTED map
16. Return the result
17. Inside the main method, create a map called COMPUTED
18. Create a constant BigInteger called previous and set it to 0
19. Create a for loop with variable k from 1 to 100
20. Calculate the current value using the sterling1 method
21. Compare the current value with the previous value
22. If the current value is greater than the previous value, update the previous value
23. If not, print the previous value and its length, then break the loop.
