  Import necessary libraries
  Create a class SymmetricDifference
    Create a main method
      Create setA and setB with initial values
      Print the initial data set for setA and setB
      Find the elements that are not in setA but are in setB and store in notInSetA
      Find the elements that are not in setB but are in setA and store in notInSetB
      Combine notInSetA and notInSetB to get symmetricDifference
      Combine setA and setB to get union
      Find the intersection of setA and setB and store in intersection
      Find the symmetric difference using union and intersection and store in symmetricDifference2
      Print the results for notInSetA, notInSetB, symmetricDifference, and symmetricDifference2
