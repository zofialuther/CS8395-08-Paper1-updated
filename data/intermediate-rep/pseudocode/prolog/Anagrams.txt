```
1. Import the http_open module
2. Define the anagrams predicate
3. Open the URL 'http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt'
4. Read the file and store the output in Out
5. Close the input stream
6. Sort the list Out and store the result in MOut
7. Group the pairs in MOut by key and store the result in GPL
8. Sort the list GPL in decreasing order of the length of values and store the result in GPLSort
9. Extract the first 6 items from GPLSort and store them in T1-T6
10. Convert the lists of codes T1-T6 to strings and store the result in L
11. Print each string in L
12. Define the read_file predicate to read the file and store the result in L1
13. Read a line from the input stream and store it in W
14. If the line is the end of the file, set L1 to L
15. Otherwise, sort the list of codes of the line and store the result in W1
16. Create the key in alphabetic order and store it in A
17. Add the pair A-W to the result list and call read_file recursively
18. Define the my_compare predicate to sort the list of pairs Key-Values
19. If the length of the values V1 and V2 is the same, compare the keys K1 and K2
