```
1. Import the PCE library
2. Define the pendulum predicate
   - Create a new window for the pendulum
   - Set the size of the window to 560x300
   - Create a line for the pendulum
   - Create a small circle for the pivot point of the pendulum
   - Set the fill pattern for the circle
   - Create a larger circle for the pendulum bob
   - Set the fill pattern for the bob
   - Display the small circle at a specific point in the window
   - Set the handle for the small circle
   - Set the handle for the large circle
   - Connect the small circle to the large circle with a line
   - Create a new animation object
   - Set the done message for the window
   - Start the timer for the animation
   - Open the window
3. Define the animation class
   - Define variables for the window, bob, pendulum length, angle, delta, and timer
   - Define an initialize method to create the object with specified parameters
   - Define an unlink method to stop the timer and free resources when the object is destroyed
   - Define an anim_message method to update the position and angle of the bob in the animation
4. Define the calc predicate to compute the position of the bob
5. Define the next_Angle predicate to compute the next angle based on the current angle and delta
