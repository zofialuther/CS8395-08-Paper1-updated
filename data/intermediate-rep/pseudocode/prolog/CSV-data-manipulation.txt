test :
- Set InFile to 'test.csv'
- Set OutFile to 'test.out.csv'
- Call augment with InFile and OutFile as arguments

augment(InFile, OutFile) :
- Open OutFile in write mode and assign the file stream to OutStream
- Repeat the following steps:
  - Read a row from InFile and assign it to Row, with Line as the line number
  - If reading the row was successful, do the following:
    - Call addrow with Row as the Term and assign the result to Out
    - Write Out to the OutStream as a CSV row
  - If reading the row was not successful, close the OutStream
- Close the OutStream

addrow(Term, NewTerm) :
- Extract the functor and the list of items from Term
- Get the first item from the list and assign it to X
- If X is an integer, calculate the sum of the list and assign it to Sum; otherwise, assign 'SUM' to Sum
- Append Sum to the end of the list and assign it to NewList
- Create a new term with the same functor as Term and NewList as the list of items, and assign it to NewTerm
