1. Create a function called do_find_closest_points with a parameter for a list of points.

2. Create an empty list called closest_points.

3. Use a nested loop to iterate through each point in the list of points.

4. For each point, calculate the distance to all other points in the list using the distance formula.

5. Store the distances and corresponding points in a dictionary.

6. Sort the distances in ascending order.

7. Retrieve the first two points from the sorted distances and add them to the closest_points list.

8. Return the closest_points list.
