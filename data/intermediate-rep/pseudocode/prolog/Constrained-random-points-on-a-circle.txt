```
1. Load the clpfd library
2. Define the predicate circle
3. Use bagof to get a list of points from init(X,Y) and store it as BL
4. Get the length of BL and store it as N
5. Create a list L of length 100
6. Use maplist to choose N points from BL and store them in L
7. Call the draw_circle predicate with the list L as an argument

8. Define the choose predicate with parameters BL, N, V
9. Generate a random index I between 0 and N
10. Get the element at index I from BL and store it as V

11. Define the init predicate with parameters X1, Y1
12. Define variables X and Y with domains between -15 and 15
13. Add constraints for X^2 + Y^2 to be greater than or equal to 100 and less than or equal to 225
14. Label the variables X and Y
15. Calculate X1 as 10 times X plus 200
16. Calculate Y1 as 10 times Y plus 200

17. Define the draw_circle predicate with parameter L
18. Create a new window D with the title 'Circle'
19. Set the size of window D to 400x400
20. For each point [X,Y] in L, create a circle C with radius 4, fill pattern color black, and center at point (X,Y)
21. Display the circle C in window D
22. Open window D
