- Call same_or_different with "333"
- Call same_or_different with ".55"
- Call same_or_different with "tttTTT"
- Call same_or_different with "4444 444k"

same_or_different(INPUTz0):
- Format and print input string
- Call examine with INPUTz0

examine(INPUTz0):
- If input is empty, print "all the same characters"
- Otherwise, call examine with first character and rest of the input

examine([],_COMPARE0_,INDEX0,INDEX0):
- Print "all the same characters"

examine([COMPARE0|INPUTz0],COMPARE0,INDEX0,INDEX):
- If first character matches, increment INDEX0 and call examine with the rest of the input

examine([DIFFERENT0|_INPUTz0_],COMPARE0,INDEX0,INDEX0):
- Get the code of the different character
- Format and print the message with the different character, its code, the compared character, and the index
