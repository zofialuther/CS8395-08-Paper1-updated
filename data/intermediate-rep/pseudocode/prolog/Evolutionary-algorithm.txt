function target(text)
    // Define the target text

function rndAlpha(min, max)
    // Generate a single random character within the specified range
    // 32 is a space, and 65->90 are upper case

function rndAlpha(P, Ch)
    // Generate a single random character based on a random number
    // 64 is subtracted from the product of N and 27, and the result is used as the ASCII code to generate the character

function rndTxt(Len, Text)
    // Generate some random text of a fixed length

function score(Text1, Text2, Score)
    // Score a generated mutation by counting the differences between two texts

function mutate(Probability, Input, Output)
    // Mutate the input text based on the given probability and generate the output text

    // The main function to run the weasel algorithm
    // Output the progress and call itself recursively until the target is achieved
