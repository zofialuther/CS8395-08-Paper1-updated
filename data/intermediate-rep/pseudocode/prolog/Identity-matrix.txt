```
rotate(Int,List,Rotated) :
    if Int is an integer:
        find the length of Suff
        append Pre and Suff to List to get Rotated

rotate(LoInts,LoLists,Rotated) :
    if LoInts is a list:
        apply rotate to each pair of elements in LoInts and LoLists to get Rotated

append_(Suff,Pre,List) :
    append Pre and Suff to List

idmatrix(N,IdMatrix):
    create a list of N 1s
    create a list of N-1 0s
    append the 0s to the 1s to create a matrix M
    create a list of numbers from 0 to N-1 as Offsets
    rotate each row of M using Offsets to get IdMatrix

main :
    create an identity matrix I with size 5
    print each row of I
