1. Initialize an empty list called Lowers
2. Use the maplist function to iterate over each character in the list [alpha, ascii, lower]
3. For each character, use the char_type function to check if it is a lower case character and add it to the Lowers list if it is
4. Print '-- Lower Case Characters --' to the console
5. Print the Lowers list to the console
6. Print a new line to the console
7. Initialize an empty list called Uppers
8. Use the maplist function to iterate over each character in the list [alpha, ascii, upper]
9. For each character, use the char_type function to check if it is an upper case character and add it to the Uppers list if it is
10. Print '-- Upper Case Characters --' to the console
11. Print the Uppers list to the console.
