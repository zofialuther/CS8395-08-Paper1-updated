```
1. Load clpfd library

2. Define knapsack predicate
   - Set up the list of items with their properties (name, weights, value, nb pieces)
   - Use maplist to collect the weights, values, and number of items taken for each item
   - Use scalar_product to ensure the total weight of the selected items is less than or equal to 400
   - Use scalar_product to calculate the total value of the selected items (VM)
   - Use time and labeling to find the optimal solution for the maximum value (VM)
   - Use scalar_product to calculate the total weight of the selected items (WM)
   - Use compute_lenword to find the maximum length of the item names
   - Use print_results to display the selected items and their properties

3. Define collect predicate
   - Extract the weights, values, and number of items for each item

4. Define compute_lenword predicate
   - Calculate the maximum length of the item names

5. Define print_results predicate
   - Base case: Print the total weight and value of the selected items
   - If the number of a specific item is 0, skip to the next item
   - Print the name, weight, and value of the selected items
