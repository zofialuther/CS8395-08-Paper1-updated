initialize program

define board size of 8
check if a given point is within the board size
create a graph of available moves on the board

define the rules for asserting moves
define the rules for checking if a move is possible
define the rules for moving one or two spaces in either the X or Y direction

define the rules for finding a Hamiltonian path
define the rules for enumerating the possible paths
define the rules for finding the Hamiltonian path based on the given starting point and size of the board

define the rules for finding the next move in the path
define the rules for finding the possible moves for a given point

show the Hamiltonian path
define the rules for displaying the path

execute the main function to create the graph, find the Hamiltonian path, display the path, and end the program
