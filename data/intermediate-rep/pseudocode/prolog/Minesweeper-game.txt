1. Initialize the minesweeper game
    a. Set the width and height of the game
    b. Print a welcome message and instructions for playing

2. Create a new grid
    a. Generate a flat list of cells
    b. Calculate the number of bombs to place in the grid
    c. Add the bombs to the grid list
    d. Randomize the grid list and convert it into a 2D array
    e. Populate the hidden part of the grid with the number of bombs next to each cell

3. Play the game
    a. Check if the win condition is true
    b. Check if the lose condition is true
    c. If still playing, continue to expose cells and perform operations based on user input
        i. Get user input (operation, X, Y)
        ii. Perform the specified operation on the grid
        iii. Continue playing with the updated grid

4. Define operations on cells in the grid
    a. Get a value from the grid by X Y
    b. Set a value on the grid by X Y
    c. Determine the number of bombs next to a cell
    d. Print the grid
    e. Determine if the game is still being played
    f. Determine if the game has been won

5. Get user operation from input
    a. Parse the user input to determine the operation and cell coordinates

6. Perform the specified operation on the grid
    a. Mark a cell as containing a bomb
    b. Open a cell, revealing if it contains a bomb or a number
    c. Expose the grid by checking adjacent cells and updating the grid accordingly
