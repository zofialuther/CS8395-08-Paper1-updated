1. Create a function text2morse that takes in a string as input and returns the Morse code equivalent.
2. Create a dictionary mapping each letter in the alphabet to its corresponding Morse code.
3. Create an empty string variable called Morse to store the Morse code translation.
4. Convert the input string to uppercase to handle both upper and lower case letters.
5. Loop through each character in the input string:
    a. If the character is a letter, look up its Morse code in the dictionary and add it to the Morse string.
    b. If the character is a space, add a space to the Morse string.
    c. If the character is not a letter or a space, ignore it.
6. Return the Morse string.
