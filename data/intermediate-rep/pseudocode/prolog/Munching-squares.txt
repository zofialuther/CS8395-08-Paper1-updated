1. Create a new window called 'XOR Pattern'
2. Set the size of the window to 512x512
3. Create a new image called 'Img' with width 512, height 512, and kind pixmap
4. For each value I in the range 0 to 511 do the following:
   a. For each value J in the range 0 to 511 do the following:
      i. Calculate V as the result of I xor J
      ii. Calculate R as (V * 1024) mod 65536
      iii. Calculate G as (65536 - V * 1024) mod 65536
      iv. If V mod 2 is 0 then calculate B as (V * 4096) mod 65536, else calculate B as (65536 - (V * 4096)) mod 65536
      v. Set the pixel at position (I, J) in Img to the color with RGB values (R, G, B)
5. Create a new bitmap 'Bmp' using Img
6. Display Bmp at the position (0,0) in the window
7. Open the window
