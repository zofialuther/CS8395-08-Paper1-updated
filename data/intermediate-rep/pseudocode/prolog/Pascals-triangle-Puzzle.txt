```
1. Include necessary library
2. Define puzzle predicate with parameters Ts, X, Y, Z
3. Define Ts as a list of lists with specific values
4. Define Y as the sum of X and Z
5. Call triangle predicate with Ts as parameter
6. Append Ts to a list Vs
7. Define Vs to be in the range of 0 to infinity
8. Label Vs
9. Define triangle predicate with a list parameter
10. If the list has more than one element, call triangle_ with the first two elements and call triangle recursively with the rest of the list
11. If the list has only one element, return true
12. Define triangle_ predicate with two list parameters
13. If the first list is empty, return true
14. Otherwise, define the first element of the first list as the sum of the first two elements of the second list
15. Call triangle_ recursively with the rest of the lists
