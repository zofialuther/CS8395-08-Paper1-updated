```
1. Initialize the library clpfd.

2. Define the edges between nodes.

3. Define the predicate connected(A, B) to determine if two nodes are connected.

4. Define the predicate no_connection_puzzle(Vs) to solve the puzzle.

5. Create a list Lst of all nodes in the graph.

6. Sort the list Lst and get its length Len.

7. Create a list Vs to store the values of the nodes and ensure all values are distinct.

8. Set constraints for the connected nodes in the graph.

9. Label the values to solve the puzzle.

10. Define the predicate set_constraints(L, Vs) to set constraints for connected nodes.

11. Define the predicate set_constraint(H, T, VH, VT) to set constraints for connected nodes.

12. Check if two nodes are connected and set constraints accordingly.

13. Continue setting constraints for other connected nodes.

14. End of pseudocode.
