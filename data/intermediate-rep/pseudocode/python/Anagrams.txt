1. Import urllib
2. Import defaultdict from collections
3. Set words as the result of splitting the content of the URL "http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt" after reading it using urllib.urlopen
4. Get the length of the words list and store it
5. Create a defaultdict named anagram to map sorted characters to anagrams
6. Iterate through each word in the words list
7. Sort the characters in the word and add the word to the list of anagrams corresponding to the sorted characters
8. Find the maximum length of the lists of anagrams and store it as count
9. Iterate through each list of anagrams
10. If the length of the list is equal to or greater than count, print the list
11. Store the value of count for future reference
