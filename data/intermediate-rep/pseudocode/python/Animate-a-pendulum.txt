'''
Start
    Import necessary libraries (tkinter, math)
    
    Create a class called Animation:
        Define the __init__ method which takes the parameter gw:
            Initialize the variables for the pendulum's position and angle
            Create a canvas and pack it into the window
            Create the line and oval for the pendulum
            Call the animate method
        
        Define the animate method:
            Check if the absolute value of the angle is greater than pi / 2
                If so, change the change in angle to its negative
            Update the angle and calculate the sine and cosine
            Update the coordinates of the rod and bob
            Update the canvas and call the animate method after a delay
    
    Create a Tkinter window called root
    Set the title, geometry, and resizable properties of the window
    Create an instance of the Animation class with the root window
    Run the main loop for the window
End
