1. Import the ast module
2. Set the expression to "2 * (3 -1) + 2 * 5"
3. Parse the expression using ast.parse with mode='eval' and store the result in the variable node
4. Print the AST structure of the node using ast.dump and replace the commas with new lines
5. Compile the node into a code object with filename='<string>' and mode='eval' and store it in the variable code_object
6. Evaluate the code object using eval and print the result (should be 14)
7. Modify the AST by changing the value of 5 to 6 in the expression
8. Compile the modified node into a new code object and store it in the variable code_object
9. Evaluate the new code object using eval and print the result (should be 16)
