1. Import the sieve function from the sympy library to generate prime numbers.
2. Create a function named get_pfct that takes a parameter n.
3. Initialize variables i to 2 and factors to an empty list.
4. While i * i is less than or equal to n, do the following:
    - Check if n is divisible by i.
    - If it is, divide n by i and append i to the factors list.
    - If it's not, increment i by 1.
5. If n is greater than 1, append n to the factors list.
6. Return the length of the factors list.
7. Extend the sieve to generate the first 110 prime numbers and store them in a variable called primes.
8. Create an empty list called pool.
9. Iterate through the range from 0 to 121 and append the result of get_pfct(each) to the pool list.
10. Iterate through the elements in the pool list and their indices using enumerate.
11. Check if each element is in the primes list.
12. If it is, print the index.
