1. Import the sqrt function from the math module
2. Define a function named qmean that takes a list of numbers, num, as input
3. Inside the qmean function, calculate the sum of the squares of each number in the input list using a generator expression
4. Divide the sum by the length of the input list to get the mean
5. Use the sqrt function to calculate the square root of the mean
6. Return the square root as the result of the qmean function
7. Call the qmean function with a range of numbers from 1 to 10 and print the result.
