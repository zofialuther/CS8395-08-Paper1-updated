1. Create a function called commaQuibble that takes a list s as input
2. Inside the function, return a formatted string using the join method to join the elements of the list with " and " and then replace the last " and " with a comma
3. The number of replacements is calculated as the length of the list minus 2
4. Loop through a list of sequences, including an empty list, a list with one element, a list with two elements, and a list with four elements
5. For each sequence, print the input sequence and the output of the commaQuibble function applied to that sequence.
