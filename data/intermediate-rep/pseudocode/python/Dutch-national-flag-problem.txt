1. Import the itertools library
2. Define a function dutch_flag_sort2 that takes in two parameters: items and order with a default value of colours_in_order
3. Inside the function, return a list of the chained items using the from_iterable method of itertools.chain
4. Use the filter function to filter the items based on the lambda function that checks if the color is equal to the current order
5. Return the list of the filtered items
6. End of the function definition
