1. Set eqindexMultiPass function with parameter s
2. Return a list comprehension that iterates through the range of the length of s
3. Within the list comprehension, for each index i, check if the sum of s from the start to i is equal to the sum of s from i+1 to the end
4. Print the result of eqindexMultiPass function with the input [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
