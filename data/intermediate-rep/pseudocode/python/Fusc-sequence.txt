'''
1. Define function infiniteFusc()
    - Define a function go(step) to handle the Fusc sequence
    - Return an infinite stream of Fusc sequence terms using chain, map, and iterate

2. Define function fusc(i)
    - Define a function go(n) to handle the Fusc sequence for a given integer
    - Return the Fusc sequence for the input integer

3. Define function firstFuscOfEachMagnitude()
    - Create a non-finite stream of each term in the Fusc sequence that requires an unprecedented quantity of decimal digits
    - Use the map and enumerate functions to generate the stream

4. Define function main()
    - Print the first 61 terms of the Fusc sequence
    - Print the first term of each decimal magnitude in the Fusc sequence

5. Define function iterate(f)
    - Generate an infinite list of repeated applications of f to x

6. Define function showList(xs)
    - Convert a list to a compact string

7. Define function take(n)
    - Return the prefix of xs of length n, or xs itself if n > length xs
