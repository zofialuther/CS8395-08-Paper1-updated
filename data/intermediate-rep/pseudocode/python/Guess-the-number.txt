1. Import the random module
2. Generate a random number 't' between 1 and 10 using random.randint(1, 10)
3. Set 'g' to 0
4. Prompt the user to input a guess for a number between 1 and 10
5. Convert the input to an integer and store it in 'g'
6. While the guess 'g' is not equal to the random number 't', do the following:
   a. Prompt the user to input another guess
   b. Convert the input to an integer and store it in 'g'
7. Once the guess 'g' matches the random number 't', print "That's right!"
