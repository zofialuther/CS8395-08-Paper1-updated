1. Import the itertools module to use islice.
2. Create a function called hailstone that takes a parameter n.
3. Inside the hailstone function, use the yield keyword to generate the value of n.
4. Use a while loop to continue generating the hailstone sequence until n is greater than 1.
5. Inside the while loop, update the value of n using the hailstone sequence formula.
6. Use the yield keyword to generate the updated value of n.
7. If the condition is met, continue generating the hailstone sequence.
8. At the end of the function, create an if statement to check if the current script is being executed as the main program.
9. Inside the if statement, create a variable h and assign it the value of calling the hailstone function with the argument 27.
10. Use the assert keyword to check if the first 4 values of the hailstone sequence match the expected values.
11. Create a for loop to iterate a certain number of times.
12. Use the next function to continue generating the hailstone sequence.
13. Use the assert keyword to check if the next 4 values of the hailstone sequence match the expected values.
14. Find the maximum length of the hailstone sequence for numbers less than 100,000.
15. Print the maximum length and the corresponding number that achieves that maximum length.
