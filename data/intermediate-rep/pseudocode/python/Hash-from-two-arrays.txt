1. Initialize keys as a list containing elements 'a', 'b', 'c'
2. Initialize values as a list containing elements 1, 2, 3
3. Initialize an empty dictionary hash
4. Use a for loop to iterate through the result of the zip function on keys and values
   4.1 For each pair of key and value, add an entry to the hash dictionary with key as the key and value as the value
5. End loop
6. Return the hash dictionary
