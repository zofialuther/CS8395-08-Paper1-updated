1. Import the collections and sys modules
2. Define a function called filecharcount that takes openfile as a parameter
3. Inside the function, use a generator expression to iterate through each character in each line of the openfile and count the occurrences of each character using collections.Counter
4. Sort the result of the counter and return it as a list of (character, count) tuples
5. Open the file specified in the command line argument using sys.argv[1]
6. Print the result of calling filecharcount with the opened file as the argument.
