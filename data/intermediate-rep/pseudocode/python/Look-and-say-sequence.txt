1. Import the regular expression module
2. Define a function called lookandsay that takes a string as input
3. Inside the function, use the re.sub() method to replace characters in the string using a regular expression pattern and a lambda function
4. The regular expression pattern matches a single character followed by zero or more occurrences of the same character
5. In the lambda function, return the length of the matched group followed by the character itself
6. Outside the function, initialize a variable called num with the value "1"
7. Use a for loop to iterate 10 times
8. Inside the loop, print the value of num
9. Update the value of num by calling the lookandsay function with num as the argument and assigning the result back to num.
