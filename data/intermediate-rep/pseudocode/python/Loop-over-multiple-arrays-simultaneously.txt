1. Create a function called "print_zip" that takes three strings as parameters: str1, str2, and str3.
2. Initialize a variable "zipped" to store the result of zipping str1, str2, and str3 together.
3. Initialize a variable "joined" to store the result of joining each group of characters in "zipped".
4. Print the "joined" variable with each group separated by a new line.
