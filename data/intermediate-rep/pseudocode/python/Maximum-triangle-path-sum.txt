1. Import the itertools module and specifically the imap function
2. Define a lambda function f that takes three parameters x, y, and z and returns the sum of x and the maximum of y and z
3. Define a lambda function g that takes two parameters xs and ys and returns a list of the result of applying the function f to each element of ys, the corresponding element of xs, and the next element of xs
4. Read the data from the "triangle.txt" file, split each row, convert the values to integers, and store the result in a list called data. Reverse the list.
5. Print the result of applying the reduce function to g and the data list, and take the first element of the result.
