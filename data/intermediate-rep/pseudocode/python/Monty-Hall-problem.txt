1. Import the random module to generate random numbers.
2. Define the number of doors and the number of iterations.
3. Create a function called monty_hall with parameters choice, switch (default False), and doorCount (default to doors).
4. Inside the monty_hall function, set up the doors with a prize behind one of them.
5. Check if the chosen door is the one with the prize.
6. Create a list of unpicked doors and remove the chosen door from the list.
7. Determine the alternative door based on the remaining unpicked doors.
8. If the switch parameter is True, return the alternative door, else return the chosen door.
9. Print a simulation of the Monty Hall problem with the specified number of doors and iterations.
10. Print the results of not switching and switching after running the simulation for the specified number of iterations.
