Pseudocode:

Import print_function from __future__
Import count, islice from itertools

Function narcissists:
    For digits in count starting at 0:
        Set digitpowers to an empty list
        For i in range 0 to 9:
            Append i raised to the power of digits to digitpowers
        For n in range 10^(digits-1) to 10^digits:
            Set div to n
            Set digitpsum to 0
            While div is not 0:
                Set div and mod to divmod(div, 10)
                Add digitpowers[mod] to digitpsum
            If n is equal to digitpsum:
                Yield n

For i, n in enumerate the first 25 elements of narcissists:
    Print n with a space as the end character
    If i is divisible by 5, print a new line
Print a new line to finish the output.
