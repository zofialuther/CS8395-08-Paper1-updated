1. Import the urllib.request module
2. Set the variable "url" to the URL 'http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt'
3. Use urllib.request.urlopen() to open the URL and read the data, then decode it using "utf-8" and split the words into a list called "words"
4. Create a new list called "ordered" by iterating through each word in the "words" list and checking if it is equal to its sorted version
5. Find the maximum length of the words in the "ordered" list and store it in the variable "maxlen"
6. Create a new list called "maxorderedwords" by iterating through each word in the "ordered" list and checking if its length is equal to "maxlen"
7. Print the words in "maxorderedwords" joined by a space.
