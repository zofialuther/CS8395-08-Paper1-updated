Pseudocode:

Import required modules: pokerhand, itertools, random

Define class Deck:
    Initialize method:
        Set self.__deck as a list comprehension of Card objects using product of face and suit
    Represent method:
        Return 'Deck of ' + ' '.join(repr(card) for card in self.__deck)
    Shuffle method:
        Not implemented
    Deal method:
        Return and remove a random card from self.__deck

If __name__ is '__main__':
    Create a new deck object
    Print '40 cards from a deck:'
    Loop 5 times:
        Loop 8 times:
            Print the result of deck.deal()
        Print a new line
    Print 'The remaining cards are a', followed by the deck object
