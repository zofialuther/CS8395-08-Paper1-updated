Import floor and sqrt from math

Define a function called fac that takes a parameter n
    Set step to a lambda function that takes a parameter x and returns 1 + (x<<2) - ((x>>1)<<1)
    Set maxq to the floor of the square root of n
    Set d to 1
    Set q to 2 if n modulo 2 equals 0, else set it to 3
    While q is less than or equal to maxq and n modulo q is not equal to 0
        Set q to the result of the step function with parameter d
        Increment d by 1
    If q is less than or equal to maxq
        Return a list containing q and the result of calling fac with parameter n integer divided by q
    Else
        Return a list containing n

If the name of the current module is equal to '__main__'
    Import the time module
    Set start to the current time
    Set tocalc to 2 raised to the power of 59 minus 1
    Print the string "%s = %s" with the values tocalc and the result of calling fac with parameter tocalc
    Print the string "Needed %ss" with the value of the current time minus start
