1. Import the regular expression module (re)
2. Define a function called rangeexpand that takes a string parameter txt
3. Create an empty list called lst
4. Split the input string txt by commas and iterate through each range
5. Use regular expression to match the start and end of the range
6. If end is found, use xrange to generate a list of numbers from start to end+1 and add it to the lst
7. If end is not found, append the start to the lst
8. Return the list lst containing the expanded range.
