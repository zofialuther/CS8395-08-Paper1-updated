'''
1. Import required modules
2. Define function romanFromInt(n) that takes an integer n as input
    3. Define sub-function go(a, ms) that takes a tuple (a, ms) as input
        4. Calculate q and r by dividing a by m
        5. Return a tuple of (r, s * q)
    6. Return the result of concatenating the second element of the result of mapAccumL(go) with n and a list of tuples of Roman numeral values and their corresponding symbols
7. Define function main() that takes no input
    8. Iterate through a list of Roman numerals generated from a list of integers using romanFromInt
        9. Print each Roman numeral
10. Define function concat(xxs) that takes a list of lists or strings as input
    11. Convert the list of lists into a single list
    12. Return an empty string if the input is a string, otherwise return an empty list if the input list is empty, otherwise return the concatenated string or list
13. Define function mapAccumL(f) that takes a function f as input
    14. Define sub-function go(a, x) that takes a tuple (a, x) as input
        15. Apply function f to a[0] and x
        16. Return a tuple of (tpl[0], a[1] + [tpl[1]])
    17. Return a lambda function that takes an accumulation acc and a list xs as input and applies reduce to xs with go as the accumulator function
18. Define function snd(tpl) that takes a tuple tpl as input
    19. Return the second element of the tuple tpl
20. If the script is run as the main program, call the main function
