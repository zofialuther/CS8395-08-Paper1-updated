1. Import the necessary modules: itertools and more_itertools
2. Define a function called is_sorted that takes a sequence as input
3. Inside the function, use the windowed function to iterate through pairs of values in the sequence
4. Check if each pair is in ascending order, return True if all pairs are sorted, otherwise return False
5. Define a function called permutation_sort that takes a sequence as input
6. Inside the function, use the permutations function to generate all possible permutations of the input sequence
7. Iterate through each permutation and check if it is sorted using the is_sorted function
8. Return the first sorted permutation found.
