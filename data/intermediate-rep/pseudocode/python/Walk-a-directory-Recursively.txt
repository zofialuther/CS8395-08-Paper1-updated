1. Import fnmatch
2. Import os and os.path
3. Define a function called print_fnmatches that takes in three parameters: pattern, dir, and files
4. Inside the function, iterate through each filename in the files list
5. Check if the filename matches the pattern using fnmatch
6. If it does, print the joined path of the directory and filename using os.path.join
7. Outside the function, use os.path.walk to walk through the directory '/'
8. Pass the print_fnmatches function as the callback, along with the pattern '*.mp3' as the second argument.
