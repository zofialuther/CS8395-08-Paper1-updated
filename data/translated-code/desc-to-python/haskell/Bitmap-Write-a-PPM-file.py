```python
# This code is not a direct translation of the given Haskell module, as Python does not have the same concept of monads and language extensions. However, a similar functionality can be achieved using Python's file I/O and image processing libraries.

# Import necessary modules
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Define function to read Netpbm file
def readNetpbm(path, color_type):
    # Add code to read Netpbm file and return Image in RealWorld monad

# Define function to write Netpbm file
def writeNetpbm(image, path):
    # Add code to write Image to file at specified path

```
