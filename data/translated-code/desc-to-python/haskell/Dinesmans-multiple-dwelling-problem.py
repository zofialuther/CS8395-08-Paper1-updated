```python
# This is not a direct translation of the Haskell code, but here's an example of how the Dinesman problem can be solved in Python using itertools.permutations and list comprehensions.

import itertools

people = ["Baker", "Cooper", "Fletcher", "Miller", "Smith"]
floors = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

permutations = list(itertools.permutations(floors))

for perm in permutations:
    if (perm.index(1) != 2
        and abs(perm.index(5) - perm.index(2)) != 1
        and abs(perm.index(1) - perm.index(3)) != 1
        and perm.index(4) != 0
        and abs(perm.index(1) - perm.index(2)) != 1):
        print("Valid solution:", [(person, floor) for person, floor in zip(people, perm)])

# The code above generates and filters all possible combinations of floor assignments until it finds a valid solution, then prints out the first valid solution as well as all valid solutions.
