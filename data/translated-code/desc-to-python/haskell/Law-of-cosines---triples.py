def generate_triangles(map, value1, value2, value3, value4):
    # Function to generate triangles based on a given map of integer values
    # Takes a map and four integer values as input
    # Returns a list of tuples representing the sides of valid triangles
    # Code also includes tests for different scenarios, such as triangles with maximum side 13 and triangles with uneven sides of maximum length 10000 at a 60-degree angle

    # Your code here
