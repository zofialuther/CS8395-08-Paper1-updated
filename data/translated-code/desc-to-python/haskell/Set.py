```python
# Python code demonstrating various list operations

# Create a list with duplicate elements removed
s3 = list(set(s3))

# Create another list
s4 = [...]

# Combine the two lists and remove duplicates
combined_list = list(set(s3 + s4))

# Return the common elements between the two lists
common_elements = list(set(s3) & set(s4)

# Get the difference between the two lists
difference = [x for x in s3 if x not in s4]

# Insert an element at the beginning of a list
s3.insert(0, element)

# Remove the first occurrence of an element
s3.remove(element)
