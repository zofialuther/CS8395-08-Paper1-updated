```python
# This code creates a yin-yang diagram using the diagrams library in Haskell.
# It defines the shape and color of the yin-yang symbol and then uses the Cairo backend to render it.
# The main function pads and places two yin-yang diagrams next to each other.
# The code also includes language extensions to remove monomorphism restriction.

# Python does not have a direct equivalent to the diagrams library in Haskell, so the code cannot be directly translated to Python.
