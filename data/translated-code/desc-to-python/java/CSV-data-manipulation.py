```python
# This code is a Python program that reads data from a CSV file containing employee information, processes the data, and writes the processed information to a new CSV file.

# Configure the CSV reader
csv_reader_settings = {
    'line_separator': '\n',
    'bean_list_processor': BeanListProcessor(Employee)
}
csv_reader = CSVReader('employee_data.csv', **csv_reader_settings)

# Parse the rows from the CSV file into a list of employee beans
employee_data = csv_reader.parse()

# Additional operations such as storing the data, deleting duplicates, and rearranging words in a specific order
# ...

# Set up the CSV writer
csv_writer_settings = {
    'bean_writer_processor': BeanWriterProcessor(Employee)
}
csv_writer = CSVWriter('processed_employee_data.csv', **csv_writer_settings)

# Write the processed employee data to a new CSV file
csv_writer.write(employee_data)
