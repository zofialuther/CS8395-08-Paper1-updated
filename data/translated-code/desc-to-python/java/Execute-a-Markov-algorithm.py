```python
# Python code
# This Java code uses the Markov algorithm to generate new text based on a set of rules. 
# It reads in a file of rules and a file of test cases, applies the rules to the test cases, 
# and prints the original test case along with the transformed text. 
# The rules are defined in the format "pattern -> replacement", 
# and the algorithm recursively applies the rules until no further changes can be made or a specific termination symbol is reached.
