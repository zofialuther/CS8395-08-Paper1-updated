```python
# Python code for solving a maze
# Read the maze layout from a file or from standard input
# Decimate the maze horizontally to make each cell the same size
# Solve the maze recursively using a depth-first search algorithm
# Expand the maze horizontally to "look right" once the solution is found
# Convert the maze back to lines of strings
# Main method reads the maze, solves it, and prints the solved maze to the console
