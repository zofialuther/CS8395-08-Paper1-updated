```python
# This code is a Python program that calculates the solutions to Pell's equation, which is a type of Diophantine equation. 
# The main method loops through a set of predetermined values of n and uses the pellsEquation method to calculate the corresponding values of x and y that satisfy the equation x^2 - n * y^2 = 1. 
# The pellsEquation method uses continued fractions to iteratively calculate the solutions, and the iterateFrac method is used to perform the calculations for the continued fractions. 
# The program then prints out the results in a formatted manner.
