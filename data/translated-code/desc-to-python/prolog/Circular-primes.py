```python
# This code is a Prolog program that utilizes the primality library to find and display the first 23 circular prime numbers.
# It defines the concept of circular primes and uses various predicates to generate and check for circular prime numbers.
# The main predicate "main" is used to find and output the first 23 circular prime numbers.
# The program utilizes recursion and mathematical operations to achieve its goal.

# Python does not have built-in support for Prolog, so this code cannot be directly translated to Python.
