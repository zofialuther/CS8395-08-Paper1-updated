```python
# This code is a Prolog program that defines a graph with weighted edges and finds the shortest path between two nodes.
# It uses dynamic predicates to store and update the shortest path and distance.
# The 'traverse' predicate is used to explore all reachable nodes and update the shortest path and distance if a shorter path is found.
# The 'go' predicate is used to find the shortest path between two specified nodes and outputs the path and distance if a route exists.
