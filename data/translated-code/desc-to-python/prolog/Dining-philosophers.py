```python
# Define the dining philosophers problem simulation

# Create a window to display the philosophers, forks, and statistics

# Model the behavior of the philosophers and a waiter who gives and takes back the forks necessary for eating

# Define the states of thinking, waiting, and eating for the philosophers

# Collect statistics for each philosopher's activities

# Simulate the changing position and status (free or used) of the forks during the simulation
