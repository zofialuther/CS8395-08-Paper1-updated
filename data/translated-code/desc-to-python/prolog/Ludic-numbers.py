# This is a Prolog program that defines predicates for generating Ludic numbers and performing specific tasks on them.

# Define a predicate g/2 to generate a list of Ludic numbers up to N
def g(N, Result):
    # Implementation of g/2 predicate

# Define predicates for filtering and manipulating Ludic numbers
def s(List, Start, End, Result):
    # Implementation of s/4 predicate

def t(List, Condition):
    # Implementation of t/2 predicate

def t1(List):
    # Implementation of t1/1 predicate

def t2(List):
    # Implementation of t2/1 predicate

def t3(List):
    # Implementation of t3/1 predicate

def t4(List):
    # Implementation of t4/1 predicate
