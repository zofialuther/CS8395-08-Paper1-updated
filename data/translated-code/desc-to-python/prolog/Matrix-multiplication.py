```python
# This Prolog code contains predicates for performing matrix multiplication and calculating the dot product of two vectors.
# It utilizes the clpfd library for the transpose operation.
# The dot/3 predicate takes two vectors and calculates their dot product, while the mmult/3 predicate performs matrix multiplication on lists of lists representing matrices M1 and M2 to produce the resulting matrix M3.
# The code also includes helper predicates for performing element-wise product and sum operations.

# Predicate for calculating the dot product of two vectors
def dot(vector1, vector2, Result):
    Result = sum([x*y for x, y in zip(vector1, vector2)])

# Predicate for performing matrix multiplication
def mmult(M1, M2, M3):
    M3 = [[sum(x*y for x, y in zip(row, col)) for col in zip(*M2)] for row in M1]
