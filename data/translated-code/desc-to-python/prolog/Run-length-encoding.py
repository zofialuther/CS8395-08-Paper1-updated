```python
# This Prolog code defines a run-length encoding and decoding system
# encode predicate takes a list of characters and encodes it into a compressed format
# decode predicate reverses the process, decoding the compressed format back into the original list
# packList predicate packs repeated elements into sublists
# run predicate counts consecutive occurrences of an element
# use of the clpfd library ensures packList predicate works bidirectionally
# example queries demonstrating the functionality of the packList predicate

# Python does not support Prolog's syntax and predicates directly
# The functionality described can be implemented in Python using lists and loops
