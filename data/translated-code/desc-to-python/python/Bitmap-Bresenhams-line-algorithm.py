```python
class Bitmap:
    def line(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        # Bresenham's line algorithm implementation
        # Calculate the points that the line passes through
        # Set these points on the bitmap image
        # Handle cases where the line is vertical or the end point is before the starting point
        pass
