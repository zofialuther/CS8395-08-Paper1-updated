```python
# Python code to compute the nearest pair of points using brute force and divide and conquer algorithms

# Function to perform brute force comparison of every possible pair of points
def brute_force_nearest_pair(points):
    # Your code here

# Function to perform divide and conquer approach to find nearest pair of points
def divide_and_conquer_nearest_pair(points):
    # Your code here

# Function to compare the execution time of the two algorithms
def compare_execution_time(points):
    # Your code here

# Function to generate random 2D points and test both algorithms
def generate_and_test_points(num_points):
    # Your code here

# Example usage
num_points = 10
points = generate_and_test_points(num_points)
compare_execution_time(points)
```
