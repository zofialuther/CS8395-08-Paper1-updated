# Python code
# Create a new file called X.java
with open('X.java', 'w') as file:
    file.write('public class X{public static void main(String[] args){System.out.println("Hello Java!");}}')

# Compile X.java using javac
# Run X using java
# Print "Hello Java!"
# This part of the pseudocode cannot be directly translated to Python as it involves running Java code.
